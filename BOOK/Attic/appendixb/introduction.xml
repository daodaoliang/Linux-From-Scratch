<para>This appendix lists all the installation dependencies for all the
packages that are installed in this book. The listings will include
which programs from which packages are needed to successfully compile
the package to be installed.</para>

<para>These are not running dependencies, meaning they don't tell you
what programs are needed to use that packages programs. Just the ones
needed to compile it.</para>

<para>The dependency list can be, from time to time, outdated in regards
to the current used package version. Checking dependencies takes quite a
bit of work, so they may lag behind a bit on the package update. But
often with minor package updates, the installation dependencies hardly
change, so they'll be current in most cases. If we upgrade to a major
new release, we'll make sure the dependencies are checked too at the
same time.</para>
