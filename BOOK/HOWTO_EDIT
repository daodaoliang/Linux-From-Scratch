How to edit the LFS-BOOK
------------------------

This document explains the necessary steps to be taken in order to make
changes to the LFS-BOOK. Not every single aspect is detailed, just the
more tricky ones.

* No matter what, always make the following changes whenever you do
  something:

Whenever you make a change, no matter how small, update the book's version 
number:

1) Open the index.xml file.

2) Find <!ENTITY version "yyyymmdd"> and make sure it contains the date on 
which you are making the change. If today is June 11th, 2001, change it 
to <!ENTITY version "20010611".

3) Find <ENTITY releasedate "Month, day, year"> and make sure it contains 
the same date as the 'version' entity. If today is June 11th, 2001, change 
it to: <!ENTITY releasedate "June 11th, 2001">



* Adding a new package update to Bugzilla

1) Login to bugzilla

2) Open bug #30

3) Check if the package is listed from a previous update

4) If so, reopen it and change the version number to match the new one

5) If not, add a new bug and fill it out as usual

6) When added, go back to the new bug and under "Bug xx depends on"
enter "30" so that this new bug is added to the parent bug #30

7) Click on "Commit" to commit this change
