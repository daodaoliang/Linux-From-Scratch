<sect2><title>Description</title>

<para>The C Library is a collection of commonly used functions in programs.
This way a programmer doesn't need to create his own functions for every
single task. The most common things like writing a string to the screen
are already present and at the disposal of the programmer.</para>

<para>The C library (actually almost every library) come in two flavors:
dynamic ones and static ones. In short when a program uses a static C
library, the code from the C library will be copied into the executable
file. When a program uses a dynamic library, that executable will not
contain the code from the C library, but  instead a routine that loads
the functions from the library at the time the program is run. This
means a significant decrease in the file size of a program. The 
documentation that comes with the C Library describes this in more
detail, as it is too complicated to explain here in one or two lines.</para>
