<title>Introduction</title>


<para>This appendix describes the following aspect of each and every package
that is installed in this book:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>	What every package contains</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>	What every program from a package does</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>The packages are listed in the same order as they are installed in
chapter 5 (Intel system) or chapter 11 (PPC systems).</para>

<para>Most information about these packages (especially the descriptions of
it) come from the man pages from those packages. I'm not going to print
the entire man page, just the core elements to make it possible to understand
 what
a program does. To get knowledge of all details on a program, I suggest
to start by reading the complete man page in addition to this appendix.</para>

<para>Certain packages are documented more in depth
than others, because I just happen to know more about certain
packages than I know about others. If anything should be added on the
following descriptions, please don't hesitate to email me. This list is
going to contain an in depth description of every package installed, but
I can't do this on my own. I have had help from various people but more
help is needed.</para>

<para>Please note that currently only what a package does is described and not
why it needs to be installed. That will be added later.</para>
