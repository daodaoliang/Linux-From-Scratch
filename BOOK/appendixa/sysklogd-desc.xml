<para><command>klogd</command> is a system daemon for intercepting and
logging kernel messages.</para>

<para><command>syslogd</command> logs the messages that system programs
offer for logging. Every logged message contains at least a date stamp and a
hostname, and normally the program's name too, but that depends on how
