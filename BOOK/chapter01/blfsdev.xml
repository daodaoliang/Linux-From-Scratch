<para>The blfs-dev mailing list discusses matters related to the
BLFS-BOOK (Beyond LFS).  If problems with the book come up, a bug 
or two need to be
reported, or suggestions to improve the book (such as suggestions as to
installation instructions to add) are to be made, this mailing list 
is the right one.</para>

<para>Requests for help with programs beyond the base LFS setup (not
just those in BLFS) should go to blfs-support.</para>
