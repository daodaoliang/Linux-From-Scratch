<title>blfs-support</title>

<para>The blfs-support list is for the BLFS Book and beyond.

It includes requests for help following the BLFS Book,
requests for help with packages not (yet) in
either the LFS Book or the BLFS Book,
and other requests and discussion concerning software
that might be installed on an LFS system.

It does not include topics such as
the price of beer, what hardware to buy,
or GNU versus BSD or Microsoft versus Linux flamewars.
These belong on lfs-chat,
and since blfs-support is high traffic,
please follow this rule strictly.
