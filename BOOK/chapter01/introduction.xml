Having used a number of different Linux distributions, I was never fully
satisfied with any of those. I didn't like the way the bootscripts were
arranged, or I didn't like the way certain programs were configured by
default, and more of those things. I came to realize that when I want to
be totally satisfied with a Linux system, I have to build my own Linux
system from scratch, ideally using only the source code. Not using 
precompiled packages of any kind. No help from some sort of CD-ROM or 
bootdisk that would install some basic utilities. I would use my current 
Linux system and use that one to build my own.

This, at one time, wild idea seemed very difficult and, at times, almost
impossible. The reason for most problems were due to my lack of knowledge
about certain programs and procedures. After sorting out all kinds of
dependency problems, compilation problems, etcetera, a custom-built Linux
system was created and fully operational. I called this system an LFS
system, which stands for Linux From Scratch.
