<title>How to subscribe?</title>

<para>Any of the above-mentioned mailinglists can be subscribed to by sending
an email to <ulink url="mailto:listar@linuxfromscratch.org">listar@linuxfromscratch.org</ulink> 
and writing <emphasis>subscribe listname</emphasis> as the subject 
header of the message.</para>

<para>Multiple lists at the same time can be subscribed to by using
one email. This is done by leaving the subject blank and putting all the
commands in the body of the email. The email will look like:</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>To: listar@linuxfromscratch.org
Subject:

subscribe lfs-dev
subscribe blfs-support
subscribe alfs-discuss</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>After the email is sent, the Listar program will reply with an
email requesting a confirmation of the subscription request. After
this confirmation email is sent back, Listar will send an
email again with the message that the user has been subscribed to the
list(s) along with an introduction message for that particular list.</para>
