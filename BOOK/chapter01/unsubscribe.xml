<title>How to unsubscribe?</title>

<para>
To unsubscribe from a list, send an email to
<ulink url="mailto:listar@linuxfromscratch.org">
listar@linuxfromscratch.org</ulink> and write <emphasis>unsubscribe
listname</emphasis> as the subject header of the message.
</para>

<para>
Multiple lists can be unsubscribed at the same time
using one email. This is done by writing some junk as the
subject header, something that isn't a valid command like "hello". Then 
the unsubscribe commands come in the body of the message. The email 
will look like: 
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

To: listar@linuxfromscratch.org
Subject: hello 

unsubscribe lfs-discuss
unsubscribe lfs-apps
unsubscribe alfs-discuss 

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
After the email was sent, the Listar program will reply with an  
email requesting a confirmation of the unsubscription
request. After this confirmation email is sent back, Listar will 
send an email again with the message that the user has been unsubscribed 
from the list(s).
