<title>How to unsubscribe?</title>

<para>To unsubscribe from a list, send an email to
<ulink url="mailto:listar@linuxfromscratch.org">listar@linuxfromscratch.org</ulink> 
and write <emphasis>unsubscribe
listname</emphasis> as the subject header of the message.</para>

<para>Multiple lists can be unsubscribed at the same time
using one email. This is done by leaving the subject header blank and
putting all the commands in the body of the email. The email will look 
like: </para>

<blockquote><literallayout>To: listar@linuxfromscratch.org
Subject:

unsubscribe lfs-dev
unsubscribe blfs-support
unsubscribe alfs-discuss</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>After the email is sent, the Listar program will reply with an  
email requesting a confirmation of the unsubscription
request. After this confirmation email is sent back, Listar will 
send an email again with the message that the user has been unsubscribed 
from the list(s).</para>
