<title>Download the LFS Commands</title>

<para>
LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book. These files can be
used to dump to your shell and install the packages, though some files 
need to be modified (for example when you install the console-tools 
package you need to select your keyboard layout file which can't be guessed).
</para>

<para>
These files can be used to quickly find out which commands have been
changed between the different LFS versions as well. You can download the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book version 
and run a diff on the files. That way you can see which package have 
updated installation instructions so you can modify your own scripts, or 
reinstall a package if you deem necessary.
