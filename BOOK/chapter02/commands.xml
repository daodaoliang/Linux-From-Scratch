<title>Download the LFS Commands</title>

<para>LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book.</para>

<para>These files can also be used to quickly find out which commands have
been changed between the different LFS versions as well. Download the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book
version and run a diff on the files. That way it is possible to see which
packages have updated installation instructions, so any scripts you may 
have can be modified, or you can reinstall a package if you think that
necessary.</para>

<para>A side effect is that these files can be used to dump to a shell and 
install the packages, though some files need to be modified (for 
example, when the kbd package is installed, you needed to select the 
keyboard layout file, because it can't reliably be guessed). Keep in
mind, please, that these files are not checked for correctness,
integrity and so forth. There may be bugs in the files (since they are
manually created, typo's are often inevitable) so do check them and
don't blindly trust them.</para>
