<title>Where to store the downloaded software</title>
<?dbhtml filename="download.html" dir="chapter02"?>

<para>Throughout this document, we will assume that all the
packages that were downloaded are placed somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.</para>

<para>While it doesn't matter at all where you save the downloaded
packages, we recommend storing it at least on the LFS partition. This
just makes sense because you need to have access to those those files
when you chroot to $LFS and when you boot into the LFS system, although
access when booted to $LFS could be handled other ways. $LFS/usr/src is
just a logical place to store source code, but by no means a requirement.
You may even want to create a subdirectory under $LFS/usr/src for tarball
storage. That way you can separate tarballs from temporary build
directories, but again that's up to you.</para>

<para>The next chapter contains a list of all the packages that need to be
downloaded. The LFS partition isn't created yet, so you can't store it
there yet. Just save it elsewhere for now, and when the LFS partition is
created, move them over.</para>
