<title>How to download the software</title>
<?dbhtml filename="download.html" dir="chapter02"?>

<para>Throughout this document, we will assume that all the
packages that were downloaded are placed somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.</para>

<para>A convention you could use is having a $LFS/usr/src/sources directory.
Under sources, you can create the directory 0-9 and the directories a
through z. A package like sysvinit-&sysvinit-version;.tar.bz2 is stored under
$LFS/usr/src/sources/s/. A package like bash-&bash-version;.tar.bz2 is stored 
under  $LFS/usr/src/sources/b/, and so forth.</para>

<para>The next chapter contains the list of all the packages that need to be
downloaded, but the partition that is going to contain our LFS system isn't 
created yet. Therefore, you should store the files somewhere else and later 
on move them to $LFS/usr/src/ when the chapter in which the new partition is 
prepared has been finished.</para>
