<title>Creating a file system on the new partition</title>
<?dbhtml filename="creatingfs.html" dir="chapter04"?>

<para>Once the partition is created, we have to create a new file system on
that partition. The standard file system used these days is the ext2
file system, but the so-called journaling file systems are becoming
increasingly popular too. It's of course up to you to decide which file
system you want to create, but because we have to assume and work with
something, we will assume you chose the ext2 file system.</para>

<para>To create an ext2 file system, use the mke2fs command. The LFS partition
is used as the only option to the command and the file system is created.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mke2fs /dev/xxx</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Replace "xxx" by the partition's designation (like hda11).</para>
