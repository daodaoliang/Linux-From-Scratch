<title>Creating a new partition</title>

<para>
Before we can build our new Linux system, we need to have an empty Linux
partition on which we can build our new system. I recommend a partition size
of at least 750 MB. This gives enough space to store all the tarballs and 
to compile all packages without worrying about running out of the necessary 
temporary disk space. But you probably want more space than that if you
plan to use the LFS system as your primary Linux system. If that's the
case you'd want more space so you can install additional software. If a 
Linux Native partition is already available, this subsection can be skipped.

The cfdisk program (or another fdisk like program the user prefers) is
started with the appropriate hard disk as the option (like /dev/hda if a
new partition is to be created on the primary master IDE disk). It is used 
to create a Linux Native partition, write the partition table and exit the 
cfdisk program. The new partition's designation should be remembered. It 
could be something like hda11 (as it is in my case). This newly created 
partition will be referred to as the LFS partition in this book.
