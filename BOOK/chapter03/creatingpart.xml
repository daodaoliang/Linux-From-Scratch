<title>Creating a new partition</title>

<para>
Before we can build our new Linux system, we need to have an empty Linux
partition on which we can build our new system. I recommend a partition size
of around 750 MB. This gives enough space to store all the tarballs and 
to compile all packages without worrying running out of the necessary 
temporary disk space. If a Linux Native partition is already available, 
this subsection can be skipped.

The cfdisk program (or another fdisk like program the user prefers) is
started with the
appropriate hard disk as the option (like /dev/hda if he wants to create a
new partition on the primary master IDE disk). He creates a Linux Native
partition, writes the partition table and exits the cfdisk program. 
The new partition's designation should be remembered. It could be something
like hda11 (as it is in my case). This newly created partition will be
referred to as the LFS partition in this book.
