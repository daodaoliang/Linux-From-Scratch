<title>Mounting the new file system</title>
<?dbhtml filename="mounting.html" dir="chapter04"?>

<para>Now that we've created a file system, we want to be able to access it.
For that, we need to mount it, and have to choose a mount point.
In this book we assume that the file system is mounted under
<filename>/mnt/lfs</filename>, but it doesn't matter what directory
you choose.</para>

<para>Choose a mount point and assign it to the LFS environment variable
by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS &&
mount /dev/xxx $LFS</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Replace <filename>xxx</filename> with the designation of the LFS
partition.</para>

<para>(If you decided to use multiple partitions for LFS (say one for
<filename>/</filename> and another for <filename>/usr</filename>), mount
them like this:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS &amp;&amp;
mount /dev/xxx $LFS &amp;&amp;
mkdir $LFS/usr &amp;&amp;
mount /dev/yyy $LFS/usr</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Of course, replace <filename>xxx</filename> and <filename>yyy</filename>
with the appropriate partition names.)</para>

<para>Now that we've made ourselves a place to work in, we're ready to begin
assembling the temporary tools in the next chapter.</para>
