<title>Mounting the new partition</title>

<para>Now that we've created a file system, we want to be able to access
the partition. For that, we need to mount it, and have to choose a mount
point. In this book we assume that the file system is mounted under
<filename>/mnt/lfs</filename>, but it doesn't matter what directory
you choose.</para>

<para>Choose a mount point and assign it to the LFS environment variable
by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</userinput></screen>

<para>Now create the mount point and mount the LFS file system by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS
mount /dev/xxx $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>Replace <filename>xxx</filename> with the designation of the LFS
partition.</para>

<para>If you have decided to use multiple partitions for LFS (say one for
<filename>/</filename> and another for <filename>/usr</filename>), mount
them like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir -p $LFS
mount /dev/xxx $LFS
mkdir $LFS/usr
mount /dev/yyy $LFS/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>Of course, replace <filename>xxx</filename> and <filename>yyy</filename>
with the appropriate partition names.</para>

<para>You should also ensure that this new partition is not mounted with
permissions that are too restrictive (such as the nosuid, nodev or noatime
options).  You can run the <userinput>mount</userinput> command without any
parameters to see with what options the LFS partition is mounted. If
you see nosuid, nodev or noatime, you will need to remount it.</para>
 
<para>Now that we've made ourselves a place to work in, we're ready to download
the packages.</para>
