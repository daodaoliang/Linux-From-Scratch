<title>Mounting the new partition</title>

<para>Now that we have created a file system, it is ready for use. All we have
to do to be able to access the partition (as in reading data from and writing 
data to) is mount it. If it is mounted under /mnt/lfs, this partition can 
be accessed by cd'ing to the /mnt/lfs directory. This book will assume 
that the partition was mounted under /mnt/lfs. It doesn't matter which 
directory is chosen, just make sure you remember what you chose.</para>

<para>Create the /mnt/lfs directory by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir -p /mnt/lfs</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now mount the LFS partition by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mount /dev/xxx /mnt/lfs</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Replace <quote>xxx</quote> by the partition's designation (like hda11).</para>

<para>This directory (/mnt/lfs) is the $LFS variable you have read about 
back in chapter 2. If you were planning to make use of the $LFS environment 
variable, <userinput>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</userinput> has to be executed 
now.</para>
