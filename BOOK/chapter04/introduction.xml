<para>Below is a list of all the packages that are needed to download for 
building the basic system. The version numbers printed correspond to versions of
the software that is known to work and which this book is based on.

experience problems which you can't solve yourself, then please download the
version that
is assumed in this book (in case you downloaded a newer version).</para>

<para>All the URL's below are to the ftp.linuxfromscratch.org server. We
have a couple of FTP mirrors available from which you can download the
files a well. The addresses of the mirror sites can be found in 
<xref linkend="ch01-version"/>.</para>

<para>We have provided a list of official download sites of the packages below
in <xref linkend="appendixa"/>. The LFS FTP archive only 
contains the versions of packages that are recommended for use in this book. 
You can check the official sites in Appendix A to determine whether a newer 
package is available. If you do download a newer package, we would 
appreciate hearing whether you were able to install the package using this 
book's instructions or not.</para>

<para>Please note that all files downloaded from the LFS FTP archive are files
compressed with bzip2 instead of gz. If you don't know how to
handle bz2 files, check out <xref linkend="ch02-install"/>.</para>
