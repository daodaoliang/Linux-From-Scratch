<para>Below is a list of packages you need to download for building a
basic Linux system. The listed version numbers correspond to versions
of the software that are known to work, and this book is based upon
them. Feel free to try out newer versions, but if you experience problems
with those versions, please try the recommended version first before
sending bug reports.</para>

<para>All the URLs, when possible, refer to the project's page at
<ulink url="http://www.freshmeat.net">Freshmeat.net</ulink>. The Freshmeat
pages will give you easy access to the official download sites as well as
project websites, mailinglists, FAQs, Changelogs and more.</para>

<!--
<para>For your convenience the top of the list contains a link to a file
you can use with the <ulink url="http://wget.sunsite.dk">wget</ulink>
program. Using this file and the <userinput>wget</userinput> program will
make it easy to download all the files at once, rather than downloading each
and every individual file manually.</para>
