<title>Installation of Bzip2</title>

<para>Install Bzip2 by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make CC="gcc -static" &amp;&amp;
make PREFIX=$LFS/static install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Although it's not strictly a part of a basic LFS system it's worth
mentioning that a patch for Tar can be downloaded which enables the tar
program to compress and uncompress using bzip2/bunzip2 easily. With a
plain tar, you have to use constructions like
<userinput>bzcat file.tar.bz | tar -xv</userinput> or
<userinput>tar --use-compress-prog=bunzip2 -xvf file.tar.bz2</userinput>
to use bzip2 and bunzip2 with tar. This patch provides the
<userinput>-j</userinput> option so you can unpack a bzip2'ed archive
with <userinput>tar -xvfj file.tar.bz2</userinput>. Applying this patch
will be mentioned later on when the Tar package is installed.</para>
