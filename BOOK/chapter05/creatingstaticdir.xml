<title>Creating the $LFS/static directory</title>
<?dbhtml filename="creatingstaticdir.html" dir="chapter05"?>

<para>All programs compiled in this chapter will be installed under <filename
class="directory">$LFS/static</filename> to keep them separate from the
programs compiled in the next chapter. The programs compiled here are only
temporary tools and won't be a part of the final LFS system and by keeping them
in a separate directory, we can later easily throw them away. Create the
required directory by running the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir $LFS/static</userinput></screen></para>
