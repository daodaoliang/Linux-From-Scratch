<title>Creating the $LFS/static directory</title>
<?dbhtml filename="creatingstaticdir.html" dir="chapter05"?>

<para>As explained in this chapter's introduction, everything we install
from this chapter will be installed under the <filename
class="directory">$LFS/static</filename> directory. This way it won't
pollute the LFS partition with a bunch of temporary files. All we need to
do is create this directory so we can start installing. Simply run this
command to create the directory:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir $LFS/static</userinput></screen></para>

<para>You may want to move the packages you downloaded in Chapter 3 to this
<filename class="directory">$LFS/static</filename> directory, perhaps
create a subdirectory <filename
class="directory">$LFS/static/src</filename> to keep them in.</para>
