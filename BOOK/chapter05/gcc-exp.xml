<para>
<userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-3.0.patch:</userinput> This patch
changes the compilation options so that the make only fails on the
second error, not the first.  This is required for the static build not
to fail.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>--enable-languages=c,c++:</userinput> This only builds the C
and C++ compilers and not the other available compilers as they are, on
the average, not often used. If those other compilers are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter can be omitted.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>ln -s ../usr/bin/cpp:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/lib/cpp symlink. Some packages explicitly try to find
cpp in /lib.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>ln -s ../bin/cpp:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/usr/lib/cpp symlink as there are packages that expect
cpp to be in /usr/lib.
