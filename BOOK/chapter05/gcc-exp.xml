<para><userinput>make BOOT_LDFLAGS=-static:</userinput>
This is the equivalent to make LDFLAGS=-static as we use with other
packages to compile them statically.</para>

<para><userinput>--prefix=/static:</userinput> This is NOT a typo.  GCC hard
codes some paths while compiling and so we need to pass /usr as the
prefix during ./configure.  We pass the real install prefix during the
make install command later.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-languages=c,c++:</userinput> This only builds the C
and C++ compilers and not the other available compilers as they are, on
the average, not often used. If those other compilers are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter can be omitted.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-threads=posix:</userinput> This enables C++ 
exception handling for multithreaded code.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -s gcc $LFS/static/bin/cc:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/static/bin/gcc symlink which some packages need.</para>
