<title>Installation of GCC on the normal system if necessary</title>

<para>
In order to compile Glibc-2.1.3 later on you need to have gcc-2.95.2.1
installed. Although any GCC version above 2.8 would do, 2.95.2.1 is the
highly recommended version to use. egcs-2.91.x is also known to work. If you
don't have gcc-2.95.x or egcs-2.91.x you need to install gcc-2.95.2.1 on
your normal sytem before you can compile Glibc later in this chapter.
</para>

<para>
To find out which compiler version your systems has, run the
following command:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>gcc --version</userinput>

<para>
If you normal Linux system does not have gcc-2.95.x or egcs-2.91.x 
installed you need to install it now. We won't replace the current 
compiler on your system, but instead we will install gcc in a separate 
directory (/usr/local/gcc29521). This way no binaries or header files will be
replaced.
</para>

<para>
After you unpacked the gcc-2.95.2.1 archive don't enter the newly created
gcc-2.95.2.1 directory but stay in the $LFS/usr/src directory. Install GCC by 
running the following commands:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>mkdir $LFS/usr/src/gcc-build &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>cd $LFS/usr/src/gcc-build &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>../gcc-2.95.2.1/configure \</userinput>
	<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--prefix=/usr/local/gcc29521 \</userinput>
	<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--with-local-prefix=/usr/local/gcc29521

	<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;
		--with-gxx-include-dir=/usr/local/gcc29521/include/g++ \</userinput>
	<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--enable-shared --enable-languages=c,c++
		 &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>make bootstrap &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>make install</userinput>
