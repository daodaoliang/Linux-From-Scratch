<title>Installation of Gettext</title>

<para>Prepare Gettext to be compiled:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the programs:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which can perform a number of
checks to ensure it built correctly. However, the Gettext test suite here in
Chapter 5 is known to cause problems if for instance it finds a Java compiler
on the host. It also takes a very long time to run and is considered not
critical to the success of the overall build. We therefore recommend not to run
it here. Should you choose to run it, the following command will do so:</para>

<screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
