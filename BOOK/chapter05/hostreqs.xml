<para>This version of the book uses highly advanced technologies, such as Linux
&linux-version;, NPTL (Native POSIX Threading Library) and Udev. The downside to
this is that steep requirements are placed on the host's kernel. The earliest
vanilla kernel that can safely be used to build this book is version 2.5.32,
though some vendor kernels (ie, RedHat) in the 2.4.x series also work. If your
host's kernel is at least 2.5.32, or you are using a kernel that is patched to
support NPTL, then you need not upgrade anything. However, if your kernel lacks
the necessary threading infrastructure to support NPTL, then you will need to
upgrade to the latest 2.6.x kernel.</para>

<para>As for obtaining such a kernel, let's hope you distributor has provided
a 2.6.x kernel package for you. If so, install it. If not, you'll have to
compile it yourself. If you're forced into a situation where you need to compile
it yourself, it is highly recommended that you compile your kernel in a
monolithic manner, as you probably don't want to go fiddling with your hosts
module utilities. Supposing you don't want to listen, open up the
module-init-tools tarball and check out the README on how to get module support
for 2.6.x.</para>
