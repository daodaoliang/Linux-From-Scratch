<para>
In the following chapters we will install all the software that belongs to 
a basic Linux system. After a user is done with this chapter he has a 
fully working Linux system. The remaining chapters deal with setting up 
networking, creating the boot scripts and adding an entry to lilo.conf so 
that the LFS system can be booted.
</para>

<para>
The software in this chapter will be linked statically. These programs
will be reinstalled in the next chapter and linked dynamically. The
reason for the static version first is that there is a chance that our
normal Linux system and the LFS system aren't using the same C
Library versions. If the programs in the first part are linked against
an older C library version, those programs might not work well on the
LFS system.

<para>
The key to learn what makes Linux tick is to know exactly what packages
are used for and why a user or the system needs them. Descriptions
of the package content are provided after the Installation subsection of each
package and in Appendix A as well.
</para>

<para>
We're about to start with installing the first set of packages. These
packages will be, as previously explained, linked statically.
</para>

<para>
During the installation of various packages, the user will most likely see
compiler warnings scrolling by on the screen. These are normal and can
be safely ignored. They are just that, warnings (mostly about improper
use of the C or C++ syntax, but not illegal use. It's just that, often, C
standards changed and packages still use the old standard which is not a
problem).
</para>

<para>
Before we start, it should be made sure the LFS environment variable was 
setup 
if it was planned to be used, by running the following command:

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>echo $LFS</userinput>
