<para>
<userinput>yes "" | make config:</userinput> This runs make config and
answers "Y" to every question the config script asks the user. We're not
configuring the real kernel here, we just need to have some sort of
configure file created so that we can run make dep next that will create
a few files in $LFS/usr/src/linux/include/linux like version.h among
others that we will need to compilg Glibc and other packages later in
chroot.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>make dep:</userinput> make dep checks dependencies and sets
up the dependencies file. We don't really care about the dependency
checks, but what we do care about is that make dep creates those
aforementioned files in $LFS/usr/src/linux/include/linux we will be
needing later on.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux</userinput> and
<userinput>ln -s ../src/linux/include/asm:</userinput> These
commands create the linux and asm symlinks in the $LFS/usr/include
directory that point to the proper directories in the Linux source tree.
Packages that need kernel headers include them with lines like #include
&lt;linux/errno.h&gt;. These paths are relative to the /usr/include
directory so the /usr/include/linux link points to the directory
containing the Linux kernel header files. The same goes for the asm
symlink.
