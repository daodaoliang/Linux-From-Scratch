<title>Installation of Linux Kernel</title>

<para>
We won't be compiling a new kernel image yet. We'll do that after we
have finished the installation of the basic system software in this
chapter. But because certain software need the kernel header files, we're
going to unpack the kernel archive now and set it up so that we can
compile package that need the kernel.

<para>
Create the kernel configuration file by running the following command:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>yes "" | make config</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Ignore the warning <emphasis>Broken pipe</emphasis> you might see at the
end. Now run the following commands to set up all the dependencies correctly:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>make dep</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Now that that's done, we need to create the <filename class="symlink">
$LFS/usr/include/linux</filename> and the <filename class="symlink">
$LFS/usr/include/asm</filename> symlinks. Create them by running the
following commands:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cd $LFS/usr/include &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>ln -s ../src/linux/include/linux linux &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>ln -s ../src/linux/include/asm asm</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>
