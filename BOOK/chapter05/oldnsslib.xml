<title>Copying old NSS library files</title>

<para>If your normal Linux system runs Glibc-2.0, you need to copy the NSS 
library files to the LFS partition. Certain statically linked programs still 
depend on the NSS library, especially programs that need to lookup 
usernames, userid's and groupid's. You can check which C library version your 
normal Linux system uses by simply executing the library, like this:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/lib/libc.so.6</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The first line will give you the release version. Following lines contain
interesting information. If you have Glibc-2.0.x installed on your starting
distribution, copy the NSS library files by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -av /lib/libnss* $LFS/lib</userinput></screen></para>
