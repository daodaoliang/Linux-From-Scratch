<title>Installation of Sh-utils</title>

<para>Before Sh-utils is installed, the sh-utils patch file may need to be
applied. This patch is needed to avoid a conflict of variable names with
certain Glibc versions (usually glibc-2.1.x) when compiling sh-utils
statically. It is however safe to apply the patch even if you are running
a different glibc version. So, if you aren't sure, it's best to apply
it.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../sh-utils-&sh-utils-version;.patch</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install Sh-utils by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/static \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--disable-nls &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install stage you will see the following warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>WARNING: insufficient access; not installing su
NOTE: to install su, run 'make install-root' as root</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore that warning. You need to be logged in as root
in order to install su the way Sh-utils wants to install it, which is being
suid root. Because we don't need su during Chapter 6, and su will be properly
installed when we re-install Sh-utils in Chapter 6, you can just
pretend you didn't see it.</para>
