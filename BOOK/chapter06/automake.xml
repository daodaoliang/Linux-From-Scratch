<para>Compile the package:</para>

<para>This package has a test suite available which performs a number of 
checks to ensure it will function correctly. It's worth noting that Automake
does not play a critical role in the overall operation of an LFS system. In 
addition, the Automake test suite runs for quite a long period of time. 
Accordingly, the running of the test suite here is not crucial. Should you 
choose to run the Automake test suite, the following command will do 
so:</para>

<screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>

<para>Install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
