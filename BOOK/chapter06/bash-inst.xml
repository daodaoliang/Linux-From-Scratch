<title>Installation of Bash</title>

<para>Install Bash by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --with-curses &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>logout</userinput>
<userinput>mv $LFS/usr/bin/bash $LFS/usr/bin/bashbug $LFS/bin
	&amp&amp;</userinput>
&c6-chrootcmd;</screen></para>

<para>The static bash is replaced with the dynamic bash after we exit
the chroot'ed environment, after which we re-enter it. We do this
because it's better not to replace the static bash by a dynamic one when
it's in use.</para>
