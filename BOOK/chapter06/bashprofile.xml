<title>Creating $LFS/root/.bash_profile</title>

<para>
When we have entered the chroot'ed environment in the next section we
want to export a couple of environment variables in that shell such as
PS1, PATH and others variables you want to have set. For that purpose we'll 
create the $LFS/root/.bash_profile file which will be read by bash when we 
enter the chroot environment.
</para>

<para>
Create a new file <filename>$LFS/root/.bash_profile</filename>
by running the following.
</para>

<literallayout>

<userinput>cat &gt; $LFS/root/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
# Begin /root/.bash_profile

PS1='\u:\w\$ '
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin

export PS1 PATH

# End /root/.bash_profile
<userinput>EOF</userinput>

</literallayout>

You can add more environment variables,aliases and whatever else you
need/want  at your own discretion as you deem them necessary.
