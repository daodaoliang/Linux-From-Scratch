<title>Setting up Basic Networking</title>
<?dbhtml filename="basic-net.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>Here will be set up basic networking now that all the necessary
software has been installed. There isn't all that much to do, really,
just creating a basic /etc/hosts file, and downloading some very
high-quality network information files.</para>

<para>The first step is to create /etc/hosts. This file contains
information allowing resolution of hostnames to IP addresses. Create a
very basic one (we'll make a better one later) with the following
command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>echo '127.0.0.1 $(hostname) localhost' > /etc/hosts</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now unpack the Lfs-Utils tarball again, as we're going to copy two
necessary files from it. One is the /etc/services file, which is used to
resolv service numbers to human-readable names, and the /etc/protocols
file, which does the same for protocol numbers. Copy them with the
following command after you have entered the Lfs-Utils directory:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -f etc/{services,protocols} /etc</userinput></screen></para>
