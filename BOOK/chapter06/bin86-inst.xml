<title>Installation of Bin86</title>

<para>This package is only needed if you decide to use Lilo on your LFS
system. If you're going to use something else like Grub you won't need
bin86. Check the documentation for your favorite boot loader to see if
you need the bin86 package (usually only ld86 and/or as86 from this
package are required).</para>

<para>Keep in mind, though, that it's not just boot
loaders that use the bin86 package. There is always the chance that some
other package needs programs from this package, so keep that in mind if
you decide to skip this.</para>

<para>Install Bin86 by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make &amp;&amp;
make PREFIX=/usr install</userinput></screen></para>
