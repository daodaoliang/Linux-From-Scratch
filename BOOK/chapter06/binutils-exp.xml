<para><userinput>tooldir=/usr:</userinput> Normally, the tooldir (the
directory where the executables from binutils end up) is set to
$(exec_prefix)/$(target_alias) which expands into, for example, 
/usr/i686-pc-linux-gnu. Since we only build for our own system, we don't
need this target specific directory in /usr. That setup would be used
if the system was used to cross-compile (for example 
compiling a package on the Intel machine that generates code that can be
executed on Apple PowerPC machines).</para>

<para><userinput>make tooldir=/usr install-info:</userinput> This will
install binutils' info pages.</para>

<para><userinput>cp ../binutils-&binutils-version;/include/libiberty.h /usr/include:</userinput>
The libiberty.h header file is needed in order for certain software to
compile.</para>
