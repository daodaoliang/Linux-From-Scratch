<sect2><title>Installation of Binutils</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options). Binutils
is best left alone. Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables
that override default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we
recommend unsetting or modifying them when building binutils. You have
been warned.</para>

<para>Install Binutils by running the following commands:</para>
