<title>Installation of LFS-Bootscripts</title>

<para>We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style
because it is widely used and we feel comfortable with it. If you would prefer
to try something else, Marc Heerdink has written a hint about BSD style init
scripts, to be found at <ulink url="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt"/>. And if you'd
like something more radical, search the LFS mailing lists for depinit.</para>

<para>If you decide to use BSD style, or some other style scripts, you can
skip Chapter 7 when you arrive at it and move on to Chapter 8.</para>

<para>Install the boot scripts:</para>

<screen><userinput>cp -a rc.d sysconfig /etc</userinput></screen>

<para>Give <emphasis>root</emphasis> ownership of the scripts:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown -R root:root /etc/rc.d /etc/sysconfig</userinput></screen>
