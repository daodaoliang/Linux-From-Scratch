<title>Installation of LFS-Bootscripts</title>

<para>We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style
because it is widely used and we feel comfortable with it. If you would
prefer to try something else, Marc Heerdink has written a hint about BSD
style init scripts, which may be found at
<ulink url="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt"/>.</para>

<para>If you decide to use BSD style, or some other style scripts, you can
skip Chapter 7 when you arrive at it and move on to Chapter 8.</para>

<para>Install LFS-Bootscripts by running the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -a rc.d sysconfig /etc &amp;&amp;
chown -R root:root /etc/rc.d /etc/sysconfig</userinput></screen></para>
