<title>Changing ownership of the LFS partition</title>
<?dbhtml filename="changingowner.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>Now we're in chroot, it is a good time to change the ownership of
all files and directories that were installed in chapter 5 back to root.
Run the following commands to do so:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>chown -R 0:0 /</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This command will change the ownership of the root partition to
root. 0:0 is used instead of the usual root:root, because the username
root can't be resolved because glibc is not yet installed.</para>
