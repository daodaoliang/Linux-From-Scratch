<title>Changing ownership</title>

<para>The first thing we'll do, now that we're <emphasis>root</emphasis>,
is change the ownership of the files and directories installed in Chapter 5
to root -- because when later we don't delete the
<filename class="directory">/static</filename> directory and start adding
new users, one of these users might end up owning the statically linked
programs, which is not a good idea.</para>

<para>Run the following command to make root the owner of all the statically
linked programs:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>chown -R 0:0 /static</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The command uses "0:0" instead of "root:root", because there is no way
to resolve the name "root", as glibc hasn't been installed yet.</para>
