<title>Configuring Lilo</title>

<para>
We're not going to create lilo's configuration file from scratch, but we'll
use the file from the normal Linux system. This file is different on every
machine and thus I can't create it here. Since a user would want to have the
same options regarding lilo as he has when he is using his normal Linux
system he would create the file exactly as it is on the normal system.
</para>

<para>
Copy the Lilo configuration file and kernel images that Lilo uses by
running the following commands from a shell on the normal Linux system.
Don't execute these commands from the chroot'ed shell.
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cp /etc/lilo.conf $LFS/etc</userinput>
	<userinput>cp /boot/&lt;kernel images&gt; $LFS/boot</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Before a user can execute the second command he needs to know the names of
the kernel images. He can't just copy all files from the /boot
directory. The /etc/lilo.conf file contains the names of the kernel
images he is using. Open the file and look for lines like this:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	image=/boot/vmlinuz

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Look for all <emphasis>image</emphasis> variables and their values
represent the name and location of the image files. These files will
usually be in /boot but they might be in other directories as well,
depending on the distribution's conventions.
