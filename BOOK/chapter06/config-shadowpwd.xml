<sect2><title>Configuring Shadow Password Suite</title>

<para>This package contains utilities to modify users' passwords, add
or delete users and groups, and the like. We're not going to explain what
'password shadowing' means. A full explanation can be found in the doc/HOWTO
file within the unpacked shadow password suite's source tree. There's one 
thing to keep in mind if you decide to use shadow support: programs that
need to verify passwords (for example xdm, ftp daemons, pop3 daemons) need
to be 'shadow-compliant', that is they need to be able to work with 
shadowed passwords.</para>

<para>To enable shadowed passwords, run the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/usr/sbin/pwconv</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And to enable shadowed group passwords, run the following
command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/usr/sbin/grpconv</userinput></screen></para>
