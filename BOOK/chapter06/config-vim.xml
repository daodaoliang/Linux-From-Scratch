By default Vim runs in vi compatible mode. Some people might like this,
but I have a high preference to run vim in vim mode (else I wouldn't
have included Vim in this book but the original Vi). Create the
<filename>/root/.vimrc</filename> by running the following:
</para>

<literallayout>
<userinput>cat &gt; /root/.vimrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
" Begin /root/.vimrc

set nocompatible
set bs=2

" End /root/.vimrc
<userinput>EOF</userinput>
</literallayout>

</sect2>
