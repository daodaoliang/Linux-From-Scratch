<sect2><title>Configuring Vim</title>

<para>By default vim runs in vi compatible mode. Some people might like this,
but we have a high preference to run vim in vim mode (else we wouldn't
have included vim in this book, but the original vi). Create the
<filename>/root/.vimrc</filename> by running the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; /root/.vimrc &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
" Begin /root/.vimrc

set nocompatible
set bs=2

" End /root/.vimrc
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen></para>
