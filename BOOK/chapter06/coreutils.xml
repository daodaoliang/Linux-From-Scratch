<title>Installation of Coreutils</title>

<para>Normally the functionality of <userinput>uname</userinput> is somewhat
broken, in that the <userinput>-p</userinput> switch always returns "unknown".
The following patch fixes this behaviour for Intel architectures:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&coreutils-uname-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>We do not want Coreutils to install its version of the
<userinput>hostname</userinput> program, because it is inferior to the version
provided by Net-tools. Prevent its installation by applying a patch:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&coreutils-hostname-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>Now prepare Coreutils for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>The <userinput>su</userinput> program from Coreutils wasn't installed in
Chapter 5 because it needed <emphasis>root</emphasis> privilege to do so. We're
going to need it in a few moments for the test suite. Therefore we work around
the problem by installing it now:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install-root</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which can perform a number of
checks to ensure it built correctly. However, this particular test suite
makes some assumptions with regards to the presence of non-root users and
groups that don't apply this early into the LFS build. We therefore create
a dummy system user and two dummy groups to allow the tests to run
properly. Should you choose not to run the test suite, skip down to
"Install the package".  The following commands will prepare us for the test
suite. Create two dummy groups and a dummy user name:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo "dummy1:x:1000" >> /etc/group
echo "dummy2:x:1001:dummy" >> /etc/group
echo "dummy:x:1000:1000:::/bin/bash" >> /etc/passwd</userinput></screen>

<para>Some tests are meant to run as <emphasis>root</emphasis>:</para>

<screen><userinput>make check-root</userinput></screen>

<para>The remainder of the tests are run as the <emphasis>dummy</emphasis>
user:</para>

<screen><userinput>su dummy -c "make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check"</userinput></screen>

<para>Remove the dummy groups and user name:</para>

<screen><userinput>sed -i.bak '/dummy/d' /etc/passwd /etc/group</userinput></screen>

<para>Install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>

<para>And move some programs to their proper locations:</para>

<screen><userinput>mv /usr/bin/{basename,cat,chgrp,chmod,chown,cp,dd,df} /bin
mv /usr/bin/{dir,dircolors,du,date,echo,false,head} /bin
mv /usr/bin/{install,ln,ls,mkdir,mkfifo,mknod,mv,pwd} /bin
mv /usr/bin/{rm,rmdir,shred,sync,sleep,stty,su,test} /bin
mv /usr/bin/{touch,true,uname,vdir} /bin
mv /usr/bin/chroot /usr/sbin</userinput></screen>

<para>Finally, create a few necessary symlinks:</para>

<screen><userinput>ln -s test /bin/[
ln -s ../../bin/install /usr/bin</userinput></screen>
