<title>Creating a few missing files</title>
<?dbhtml filename="createfiles.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>A few files need to be created because programs hard-wire paths
that don't exist yet. The most frequently ones used are
<filename>/bin/sh</filename> and <filename>/dev/null</filename> so we'll be
creating those for the time being and replace them properly when the file's
package is (re)installed.</para>

<para>Create the files by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s /static/bin/bash /bin/sh &amp;&amp;
mknod -m 0666 /dev/null c 1 3</userinput></screen></para>
