<title>Installation of Ed</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it. Make sure it's unpacked before running the installation 
commands.</para>

<para>Ed isn't something you would personally use. It's installed here
because it can be used by the patch program if you encounter an ed-based patch
file. This happens rarely because diff-based patches are preferred these
days.</para>

<para>Install Ed by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../ed-&ed-patch-version;.patch &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
mv /usr/bin/{ed,red} /bin</userinput></screen></para>
