<title>Installation of Gawk</title>

<para>First apply a patch to fix the following issues:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Gawk's default location for some of its executables is
<filename>$prefix/libexec/awk</filename>. This location doesn't comply
with the FHS, which never even mentions a directory called
<filename>libexec</filename>. The patch makes it possible to pass a
<emphasis>--libexecdir</emphasis> switch to the configure script, so that we
can use a more appropriate location for the <userinput>grcat</userinput> and
<userinput>pwcat</userinput> binaries:
<filename>/usr/bin</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Gawk's default data directory is
<filename>$prefix/share/awk</filename>. But package-specific
directories should be named using the package name and version number
(for example: <filename>gawk-7.7.2.</filename>) and not simply the package
name, as there may be different versions of a package installed on the system.
The patch changes the name of the data directory to the correct
<filename>$prefix/share/gawk-&gawk-version;</filename>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The patch also ensures that this data directory, including its
contents, is removed on a <emphasis>make uninstall</emphasis>.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&gawk-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>Now prepare Gawk for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --libexecdir=/usr/bin</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which can perform a number of
checks to ensure it built correctly.  Should you choose to run it, the 
following command will do so:</para>

<screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
