<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options).
Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables that override
default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we recommend unsetting
or modifying them when building GCC.</para>

<para>This is an older release of GCC which we are going to install for the
purpose of compiling the Linux kernel in <xref linkend="chapter08"/>. This
version is recommended
by the kernel developers when you need absolute stability. Later versions of
GCC have not received as much testing for Linux kernel compilation. Using a
later version is likely to work, however, we recommend adhering to the kernel
developer's advice and using the version here to compile your kernel.</para>

<note><para>We don't install the C++ compiler or libraries here. However, there
may be reasons why you would want to install them. More information can be found
at <ulink url="&blfs-root;view/stable/general/gcc2.html"/>.</para></note>

<para>We'll install this older release of GCC into the non-standard prefix of
<filename class="directory">/opt</filename> so as to avoid interfering with
the system GCC already installed in <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
 .</para>

<para>Apply the patches and make a small adjustment:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&gcc-2953-patch;
patch -Np1 -i ../&gcc-2953-no-fixinc-patch;
patch -Np1 -i ../&gcc-2953-returntype-fix-patch;
echo timestamp &gt; gcc/cstamp-h.in</userinput></screen>

<para>The GCC documentation recommends building GCC outside of the source
directory in a dedicated build directory:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir ../gcc-2-build
cd ../gcc-2-build</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile and install the compiler:</para>

<screen><userinput>../gcc-2.95.3/configure --prefix=/opt/gcc-2.95.3 \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--enable-shared --enable-languages=c \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--enable-threads=posix
make bootstrap
make install</userinput></screen>
