<para><userinput>--enable-__cxa_atexit:</userinput> This option will result
in C++ shared libraries and C++ programs that are interoperable with other
linux distributions.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-clocale=gnu:</userinput> There is a risk that
some people will build ABI incompatible C++ libraries if they didn't install
all the glibc localedata. Using --enable-clocale=gnu ensures that the "right
thing" is done in all cases. If you don't want to use this option and don't
want to build all the locales, then at least make sure you installed the
<emphasis>de_DE</emphasis> locale with Glibc, since that's the specific locale
GCC will check for to determine which locale mode to use (if de_DE is
found, <emphasis>gnu</emphasis> mode is used, which is the corrent one to
use).</para>
