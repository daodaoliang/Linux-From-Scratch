<userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../glibc-2.1.3.patch:</userinput>  This applies
a patch that fixes a minor bug in Glibc. Glibc defines a few variables
names with illegal characters in the name. Bash-2.03 and older don't
complain about that but Bash-2.04 does and won't compile Glibc properly.

<para>
<userinput>--enable-add-ons:</userinput> This enabled the add-ons that
we install with Glibc: linuxthreads and crypt.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>--with-headers=$LFS/usr/include:</userinput> This makes Glibc
use the kernel header files on our LFS system and not the kernel header
files from your starting distribution which may be out-of-date or
modified.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>make install_root=$LFS:</userinput> This is the Glibc way to
specify the equivalent of --prefix=.
