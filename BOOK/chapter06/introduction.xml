<para>The installation of all the software is pretty straightforward and
you will probably think it's so much easier and shorter to give the generic 
installation instructions for each package and only explain how to 
install something if a certain package requires an alternate installation 
method. Although I agree on that, I choose to give the 
full instructions for each and every package. This is simply to avoid any 
possible confusion and errors.</para>

<para>Now would be a good time to take a look at the optimization hint 
at <ulink url="&hints-root;optimization.txt"/> if you plan on using 
compiler optimization for the packages
installed in the following chapter. Compiler optimization can make a program run
faster, but may also cause some compilation problems. If you run into problems
after having used optimization, always try it without optimizing to see if 
the problem persists.</para>

<para>Please refrain from installing more than one package at a time, even
if it may safe you time (especially with dual CPU machines). If you install
the wrong package at the wrong time, it may hard-wire program paths to
<filename class="directory">$LFS/static</filename> which will cause the
programs to stop working once the static directory is removed. The order
packages are installed in this chapter have to be followed exactly to be
sure nothing is hard-wiring the static paths.</para>
