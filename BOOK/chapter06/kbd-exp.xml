<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../kbd-&kbd-patch-version;.patch</userinput>:
This patch fixes two problems. The first one is the <userinput>loadkeys -d</userinput>
behaviour, which is broken in current kbd versions. It is necessary to fix this,
because the boot scripts rely on a proper <userinput>loadkeys -d</userinput>.
The second part of the patch changes a Makefile so some utilities that are
not installed by default (setlogcons, setvesablank and getunimap) are also
installed.</para>
