<para><userinput>--datadir=/usr/share/kbd:</userinput> This puts the kbd 
data files (fonts, keymaps, and such) in the /usr/share/kbd directory, as 
the FHS suggests.</para>

<para><userinput>rm 
/usr/share/kbd/keymaps/i386/qwerty/defkeymap.map.gz:</userinput> There 
are some problems with having a defkeymap.map.gz when that file
wants to load another keymap file. Instead of running loadkeys with the -d 
option to load the defkeymap.map.gz file, we have come up with a slightly
modified method that we use in the loadkeys bootscript (see chapter 7).
We don't load a default keymap, but instead load the proper keymap
directly, which you will need to specify in a configuration file which
that bootscript uses. This method overcomes this bug.</para>

<para>However, if you want to create a defkeymap.map.gz file regardless,
here's how you should do it:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd /usr/share/kbd/keymaps &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>ln -s &lt;path-to-keymap&gt; defkeymap.map.gz</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Replace &lt;path-to-keymap&gt; with the path to the keymap you have
selected, relative to the /usr/share/kbd/keymaps/ directory. For
example, if you have chosen the US keymap, you would replace it with
i386/qwerty/us.map.gz.</para>
