<title>Installation of Lilo</title>

<para>We have chosen Lilo as a boot loader because we feel comfortable with it, but you 
may wish to choose another. Fabio Fracassi has written a hint on 
GRUB, which is available at <ulink url="&hints-root;grub-howto.txt"/>.</para>

<para>Install Lilo by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>It appears that compilation of this package fails on certain machines
when the -g compiler flag is used. If you can't compile Lilo at
all, you should try to remove the -g value from the CFLAGS variable in the
<filename>Makefile</filename> file.</para>

<para>At the end of the installation the make install process will print a
message stating that /sbin/lilo has to be executed to complete the
update. Don't do this, as it has no use: the /etc/lilo.conf isn't present
yet. We will complete the installation of lilo in Chapter 8.</para>

<para>The standard LILO prompt, or menu, may be replaced by the
LFS logo or any logo you like. Martin Imobersteg has written a
hint about this, which is located at 
<ulink url="&hints-root;bootlogo.txt"/>.</para>
