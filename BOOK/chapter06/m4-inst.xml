<title>Installation of M4</title>

<para>
Install M4 by running the following commands:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
<userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install</userinput>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
If the base system is running a 2.0 kernel and the Glibc version is
2.1 then you will most likely get problems executing M4 in the
chroot'ed environment due to incompatibilities between the M4 program,
Glibc-2.1 and the running 2.0 kernel. If you have problems executing the 
m4 program in the chroot'ed environment (for example when you install 
the autoconf and automake packages) you'll have to exit the chroot'ed 
environment and compile M4 statically. This way the binary is linked 
against Glibc 2.0 (if he runs kernel 2.0, Glibc version is 2.0 as 
well on a decent system. Kernel 2.0 and Glibc-2.1 don't mix very well) 
and won't give any problems. 
</para>

<para>
To create a statically linked version of M4, execute the following
commands:
</para>

<para>
<screen>
<userinput>logout</userinput>
<userinput>cd $LFS/usr/src/m4-1.4</userinput>
<userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput>
<userinput>make LDFLAGS=-static</userinput>
<userinput>make prefix=$LFS/usr install</userinput>
</screen>
</para>

<para>
Now the chroot'ed environment can be re-entered and the
next package an be installed. If M4 should be re-compiled dynamically,
this can be done 
after having rebooted into the LFS system rather than chrooting into it.
