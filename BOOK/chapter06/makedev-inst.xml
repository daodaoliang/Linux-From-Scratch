<title>Creating devices</title>

<para>Note: the MAKEDEV-&makedev-version;.bz2 file you have unpacked is not an archive, so it 
won't create a directory for you to cd into.</para>

<para>Create the device files by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp MAKEDEV-&makedev-version; /dev/MAKEDEV &amp;&amp;
cd /dev &amp;&amp;
chmod 754 MAKEDEV</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now, depending on whether you are going to use devpts or not, you
can run one of two commands:</para>

<para>If you do not intend to use devpts, run:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you do intend to use devpts, then run:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic-nopty</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Note that if you aren't sure, it's best to use 
the <userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic</userinput> command as this will
ensure you have the devices you need.  If you are sure you are going to
use devpts however, the other command makes sure that you don't create a
set of devices which you don't require.</para>

<para>MAKEDEV will create hda[1-20] to hdh[1-20] and such but keep in mind
that you may not be able to use all of those devices due to kernel 
limitations regarding the max. number of partitions.</para>
