<para>Install Net-tools by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

version that was originally installed by the sh-utils package. Sometimes 
the sh-utils version gets left behind as /bin/hostname.old so you may 
wish to remove it by running 
<userinput>rm /bin/hostname.old</userinput></para>
