<title>Installation of Net-tools</title>

<para>If you don't know what to answer to all the questions asked during the
<userinput>make config</userinput> phase below, then just accept the defaults.
This will be just fine in the majority of cases. What you're asked here is a
bunch of questions about which network protocols you've enabled in your
kernel. The default answers will enable the tools from this package to work
with the most common protocols: TCP, PPP, and several others. You still need
to actually enable these protocols in the kernel -- what you do here is merely
telling the package to include support for those protocols in its programs,
but it's up to the kernel to make the protocols available.</para>

<para>The following patch will fix a small syntax problem with the source
for the mii-tool binary:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&net-tools-mii-patch;</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Prepare Net-tools for compilation with:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make config</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you intend to accept the default settings, you may skip the
questions generated by <emphasis>make config</emphasis> by running
<userinput>yes "" | make config</userinput> instead.</para>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And install it:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make update</userinput></screen></para>
