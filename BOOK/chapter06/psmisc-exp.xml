<para><userinput>--exec-prefix=/:</userinput> This will cause the
programs to be installed in <filename class="directory">/bin</filename>

programs in this package are often used in bootscripts, so they should
be in the <filename class="directory">/bin</filename> directory so they
can be used when the <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
partition isn't mounted yet.</para>
