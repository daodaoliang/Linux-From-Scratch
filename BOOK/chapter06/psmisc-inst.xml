<title>Installation of Psmisc</title>

<para>Install Psmisc by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/ &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>psmisc installs the
<filename>/usr/share/man/man1/pidof.1</filename> man page, but psmisc's
pidof program isn't installed by default. Generally that isn't a problem
because we install the sysvinit package later on which provides us with
a better pidof program.</para>

<para>It's up to you now to decide if you are going to use the sysvinit 
package which provides a pidof program, or not. If you are going to, you 
should remove psmisc's pidof man page by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>rm /usr/share/man/man1/pidof.1</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you're not going to use sysvinit, you should complete this
package's installation by creating the <filename>/bin/pidof</filename>
symlink by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd /bin
ln -s killall pidof</userinput></screen></para>
