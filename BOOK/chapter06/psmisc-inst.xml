<title>Installation of Psmisc</title>

<para>Install Psmisc by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --exec-prefix=/ &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Psmisc's pidof program isn't installed by default. Generally, this
isn't a problem because we later install the Sysvinit package, which
provides a better pidof program.</para>

<para>It's up to you to decide if you are going to use the Sysvinit 
package, which provides a pidof program, or not. If you're not going to
use Sysvinit, you should complete this package's installation by creating
the <filename>/bin/pidof</filename> symlink by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s killall /bin/pidof</userinput></screen></para>
