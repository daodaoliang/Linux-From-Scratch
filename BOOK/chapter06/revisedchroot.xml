<para>From now on when you exit the chroot environment and wish to re-enter
it, you need to run the following modified chroot command. The one at the
beginning of this chapter might not work anymore (if your host distribution
was based on glibc-2.2.x or older, the programs in <filename
class="directory">/static/bin</filename>, such as <filename>bash</filename>,
will not work anymore). The following chroot command will work regardless
of your host distribution's Glibc version.</para>

<para>Additionally, now that all software has been installed there is no
need to use anything from the <filename
class="directory">/static</filename> directory anymore.</para>
