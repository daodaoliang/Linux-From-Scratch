<title>Installation of Sh-utils</title>

<para>This package requires its hostname-patch to be applied before you
can install it. This patch suppresses the build of the hostname program
which will be installed later with the net-tools package. The hostname
program from the net-tools package is a much better version (and in some
cases even required since it supports options that are needed by some
programs such as XFree86). Apply the patch:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../sh-utils-&sh-utils-hostname-patch-version;.patch</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Prepare Shellutils to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Continue with compiling the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Finally, move some of the programs to more appropriate
locations:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mv /usr/bin/{basename,date,echo,false,pwd} /bin &amp;&amp;
mv /usr/bin/{sleep,stty,su,test,true,uname} /bin &amp;&amp;
mv /usr/bin/chroot /usr/sbin</userinput></screen></para>

<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>There is a command installed in this package which is named test. It is 
often used in shell scripts to evaluate conditions, but is more often 
encountered in the form of <command>[ condition ]</command>. These brackets 
are built into the bash interpreter, but the FHS dictates that there should be a
<filename>[</filename> binary. Create it by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s test /bin/[</userinput></screen></para>
