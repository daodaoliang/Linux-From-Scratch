<title>Installation of Vim</title>

<para>If you don't like vim to be installed as an editor on the LFS system,
you may want to download an alternative and install an editor you 
prefer. There are a few hints how to install different editors
available at <ulink url="&hints-root;">&hints-root;</ulink>.  The hints 
which are currently available are for Emacs, Joe and nano.</para>

<para>Both the vim-rt and vim-src packages need to be unpacked to install Vim.
Both packages will unpack their files into the vim-&vim-version; directory. This
won't overwrite any files from the other package. So it doesn't matter
in which order it is done. Install Vim by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE "/etc/vimrc"' &gt;&gt; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/feature.h &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>cd /usr/bin &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>ln -sf vim vi</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you plan on installing the X Window system on your LFS
system, you might want to re-compile Vim after you have installed X. Vim
comes with a nice GUI version of the editor which requires X and a few
other libraries to be installed. For more information read the Vim
documentation.</para>

<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>The FHS says that editors like vim should use /var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; 
for their temporary state files, like temporary save files for example. 
If you wish vim to conform to the FHS, you should use this command set 
instead of the one presented above:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>echo '#define SYS_VIMRC_FILE "/etc/vimrc"' &gt;&gt; \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/feature.h &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var/lib/vim &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>cd /usr/bin &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>ln -sf vim vi &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>mkdir /var/lib/vim</userinput></screen></para>
