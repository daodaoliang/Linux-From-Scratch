<title>Installation of Vim</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it. Make sure it's unpacked before running the installation 
commands.</para>

<para>If you not wish to install Vim, build instructions for
alternative editors are available at
<ulink url="&blfs-root;view/cvs/postlfs/editors.html"/>.
Currently, there are instructions for Emacs, nano, and joe.</para>

<para>Install Vim by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../vim-&vim-patch-version;.patch &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make CPPFLAGS=-DSYS_VIMRC_FILE=\\\"/etc/vimrc\\\" &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
ln -sf vim /usr/bin/vi</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you plan to install the X Window system on your LFS
system, you might want to re-compile Vim after you have installed X. Vim
comes with a nice GUI version of the editor which requires X and a few
other libraries to be installed. For more information read the Vim
documentation.</para>

<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>The FHS says that editors like vim should use /var/lib/&lt;editor&gt; 
for their temporary state files, like temporary save files for example. 
If you wish vim to conform to the FHS, you should use this command set 
instead of the one presented above:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../vim-&vim-patch-version;.patch &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr --localstatedir=/var/lib/vim &amp;&amp;
make CPPFLAGS=-DSYS_VIMRC_FILE=\\\"/etc/vimrc\\\" &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
ln -sf vim /usr/bin/vi</userinput></screen></para>
