<para>If you decided to compile your keymap file directly into the kernel
back at the end of Chapter 6, then you strictly speaking don't need to run
this loadkeys script, since the kernel has already set up the keymap for
you. You can still run it if you want, it isn't going to hurt you. It could
even be beneficial to keep it in case you run a lot of different kernels
and don't remember or want to compile the keymap into every kernel you lay
your hands on.</para>

<para>If you decided you don't need to, or don't want to use the loadkeys
script, remove the
<filename class="symlink">/etc/rc.d/rcsysinit.d/S70loadkeys</filename>
symlink.</para>
