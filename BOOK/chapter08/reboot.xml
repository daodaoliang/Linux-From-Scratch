<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>
Now that all software has been installed, bootscripts have been created, 
it's time to reboot the computer. The system is shutdown with
shutdown -r now and rebooted into LFS. After the reboot a normal
login prompt like on the normal Linux system comes up (unless XDM or
some sort of other Display Manger is used (like KDM - KDE's version of XDM)).
</para>

<para>
One thing remains to be done and that's setting up networking. After having
rebooted and finished the next chapter of this book the LFS system is
ready for use and can be used to do with it whatever is wanted.
