<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it's time to reboot
the computer. Before we reboot, let's unmount $LFS/proc and the LFS
partition itself by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If you decided to create multiple partitions, you need to umount the
other partitions before you umount $LFS, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>And you can reboot your system by running something like:</para>

<screen><userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>At the Grub menu make sure that you tell it to boot 
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> and not the default entry which will boot your
host system again.</para>

<para>After you have rebooted, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>
