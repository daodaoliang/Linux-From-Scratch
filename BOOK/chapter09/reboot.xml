<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it is time to
reboot the computer. First exit from the chroot environment:</para>

<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

<para>Then unmount the virtual files systems:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/dev/pts
umount $LFS/dev/shm
umount $LFS/dev
umount $LFS/proc
umount $LFS/sys</userinput></screen>    

<para>Unmount the LFS file system itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If multiple partitions were created, unmount the other
partitions before unmounting the main one, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>Now, reboot the system with:</para>

<screen><userinput>shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>Assuming the Grub boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the menu
is set to boot <emphasis>LFS &version;</emphasis> automatically.</para>

<para>When the reboot is complete, the LFS system is ready for use and
software can be added.</para>
