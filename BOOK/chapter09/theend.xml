<para>Well done! You have finished installing your LFS system. It may have
been a long process, but we hope it was worth it. We wish you a lot of fun
with your new shiny custom built Linux system.</para>

<para>It may be a good idea to create an <filename>/etc/lfs-release</filename>
file. By having this file it is very easy for you (and for us if you are going
to ask for help with something at some point) to find out which LFS version
you have installed on your system. Create this file by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>echo &version; &gt; /etc/lfs-release</userinput></screen>
