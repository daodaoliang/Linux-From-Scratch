  <title>Creating the $HOME/cross-tools Directory</title>

  <para>All programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> will
  be installed under <filename class="directory">$HOME/cross-tools</filename>
  to keep them separate from the host programs. The programs compiled here are
  cross tools and will not be a part of the final LFS system. By keeping these
  programs in a separate directory, they can easily be discarded later after
  their use.</para>

  <para>Create the required directory by running the following as
  the <systemitem class="username">lfs</systemitem> user:</para>

<screen><userinput>install -d $HOME/cross-tools</userinput></screen>

  <para>The next step is to create a <filename
  class="symlink">/cross-tools</filename> symlink on the host system.
  This will point to the newly-created directory in your home directory.
  Since normal users will not have permissions to write to the root tree,
  we need to exit the <command>su</command> and run the symlink command as
  <systemitem class="username">root</systemitem>:</para>

<screen><userinput>exit
LFSHOME=`su - lfs -c 'echo $HOME'`
ln -s $LFSHOME/cross-tools /
unset LFSHOME
su - lfs</userinput></screen>

  <para>TO BE REWRITTEN - The created symlink enables the toolchain to be
  compiled so that
  it always refers to <filename class="directory">/cross-tools</filename>,
  meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will work both in
  this chapter and this host architecture and in the next (when we are
  <quote>chrooted</quote> to the LFS partition).</para>
