<title>Creating the $HOME/cross-tools Directory</title>

<para>All programs compiled in <xref
linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/> will be installed under <filename
class="directory">$HOME/cross-tools</filename> to keep them separate from the
programs compiled in <xref linkend="chapter-building-system"/>. The
programs compiled here are cross tools and will not be a part of
the final LFS system.  By keeping these programs in a separate
directory, they can easily be discarded later after their use. This
also prevents these programs from ending up in the host production
directories (easy to do by accident in <xref
linkend="chapter-cross-tools"/>).</para>

<para>Create the required directory by running the following as
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis>:</para>

<screen><userinput>mkdir $HOME/cross-tools</userinput></screen>

<para>Grant <emphasis>lfs</emphasis> full access to
<filename class="directory">$HOME/cross-tools</filename> by making
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> the directory owner:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown lfs $HOME/cross-tools</userinput></screen>

<para>The next step is to create a <filename class="symlink">/cross-tools</filename> 
symlink on the host system.  This will point to the newly-created directory in
your home directory. Since normal users will not have permissions to write
to the root tree, we need to exit the su and run the symlink command as <emphasis>root</emphasis>:</para>

<screen><userinput>exit
LFSHOME=`su - lfs -c 'echo $HOME'`
ln -s $LFSHOME/cross-tools /
unset LFSHOME
su - lfs</userinput></screen>

<note><para>The above command is correct. The <command>ln</command>
command has a few syntactic variations, so be sure to check the info
and man pages before reporting what you may think is an
error.</para></note>

<para>The created symlink enables the toolchain to be compiled so that
it always refers to <filename class="directory">/cross-tools</filename>,
meaning that the compiler, assembler, and linker will work both in
this chapter and this host architecture and in the next (when we are
<quote>chrooted</quote> to the LFS partition).</para>
