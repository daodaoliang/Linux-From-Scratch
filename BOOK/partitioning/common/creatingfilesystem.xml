  <title>Creating a File System on the Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can be
  created. The most widely-used system in the Linux world is the second
  extended file system (ext2), but with newer high-capacity hard disks,
  journaling file systems are becoming increasingly popular. We will create
  an <systemitem class="filesystem">ext2</systemitem> file system.
  Build instructions for other file systems can be found at
  <ulink url="&blfs-root;view/svn/postlfs/filesystems.html"/>.</para>

  <para>To create an <systemitem class="filesystem">ext2</systemitem> file
  system on the LFS partition, run the following:</para>

<screen><userinput>mke2fs /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> with the name of the LFS
  partition (<filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename> in our previous
  example).</para>

  <note>
    <para>Some host distributions use custom features in their filesystem
    creation tools (E2fsprogs). This can cause problems when booting into
    your new LFS, as those features will not be supported by the LFS-installed
    E2fsprogs; you will get an error similar to <computeroutput>unsupported
    filesystem features, upgrade your e2fsprogs</computeroutput>. To check
    if your host system uses custom enhancements, run the following
    command:</para>

<screen><userinput>debugfs -R feature /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

    <para>If the output contains features other than: dir_index; filetype;
    large_file; resize_inode or sparse_super then your host system may have custom
    enhancements.  In that case, to avoid later problems, you should compile the
    stock E2fsprogs package and use the resulting binaries to re-create the
    filesystem on your LFS partition:</para>

<screen><userinput>cd /tmp
tar xjf /path/to/sources/e2fsprogs-&e2fsprogs-version;.tar.bz2
cd e2fsprogs-&e2fsprogs-version;
mkdir build
cd build
../configure
make #note that we intentionally don't 'make install' here!
./misc/mke2fs /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable>
cd /tmp
rm -rf e2fsprogs-&e2fsprogs-version;</userinput></screen>

  </note>

  <para>If a swap partition was created, it will need to be initialized
  for use by issuing the command below. If you are using an existing swap
  partition, there is no need to format it.</para>

<screen><userinput>mkswap /dev/<replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable> with the name of the
  swap partition.</para>
