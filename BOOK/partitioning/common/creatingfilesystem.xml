  <title>Creating a File System on the Partition</title>

  <para>Now that a blank partition has been set up, the file system can be
  created. The most widely-used system in the Linux world is the second
  extended file system (ext2), but with newer high-capacity hard disks,
  journaling file systems are becoming increasingly popular. We will create
  an <systemitem class="filesystem">ext2</systemitem> file system, however
  build instructions for other file systems can be found at
  <ulink url="&blfs-root;view/svn/postlfs/filesystems.html"/>.</para>

  <para>To create an <systemitem class="filesystem">ext2</systemitem> file
  system on the LFS partition, run the following:</para>

<screen><userinput>mke2fs /dev/<replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>[xxx]</replaceable> with the name of the LFS
  partition (<filename class="devicefile">hda5</filename> in our previous
  example).</para>

  <para>If a swap partition was created, it will need to be initialized
  as a swap partition by using the command below. If you are using an
  existing swap partition, there is no need to format it.</para>

<screen><userinput>mkswap /dev/<replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable></userinput></screen>

  <para>Replace <replaceable>[yyy]</replaceable> with the name of the
  swap partition.</para>
