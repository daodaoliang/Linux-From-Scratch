  <para>On a Sparc system we have to create special partition first. This
  partition is called Whole disk, and must be the 3rd partition on the
  disk.</para>

  <para>The other partitions are virtual slices of this Whole disk partition.
  But there are some limitations on the first partion of hda or sda on the
  system. This partition must be less than 2 gigabytes and this partition must
  be root.</para>
