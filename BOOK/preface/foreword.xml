<para>Having used a number of different Linux distributions, I was never fully
satisfied with any of them. I didn't like the way the bootscripts were
arranged, I didn't like the way certain programs were configured by
default, and more of those things. I came to realize that if I wanted to
be fully satisfied with a Linux system, I would have to build my own system 
from scratch, ideally using only the source code. Not using 
pre-compiled packages of any kind. No help from some sort of CD-ROM or 
bootdisk that would install some basic utilities. I would use my current 
Linux system and use that one to build my own.</para>

<para>This, at one time, wild idea seemed very difficult and at times almost
impossible. After sorting out all kinds of dependency problems, compile
problems, etcetera, a custom-built Linux system was created and fully 
operational. I called this system an LFS system, which stands for Linux 
From Scratch.</para>

<para>I hope all of you will have a great time working on LFS!</para>
