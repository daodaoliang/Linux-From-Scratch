<title>Who would not want to read this book</title>

<para>People who don't want to build an entire Linux system from scratch
probably don't want to read this book. If you, however, want to learn
more about what happens behind the scenes, in particular what happens
between turning on the computer and seeing the command prompt, you may 
want to read the <quote>From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO</quote>. This \
HOWTO builds a bare system, in a way similar to the one this book
uses, but it focuses more on just installing a bootable system instead
of a complete system.</para>

<para>To decide whether to read this book or the
From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO, ask yourself this 
question: "Is my main objective to get a working Linux system that I'm 
going to build myself and, along the way learn what every component of 
a system is for? Or is just the learning part my main objective?" If
you want to build and learn, read this book. If you just want to learn
the basics, then the From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO is probably 
better material to read.</para>

<para>The <quote>From-PowerUp-To-Bash-Prompt-HOWTO</quote> is located at
