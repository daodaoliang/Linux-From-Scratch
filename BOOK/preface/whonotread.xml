<para>If you do not wish to build your own Linux system from scratch, then
you probably don't want to read this book. Our goal is to build a complete
and useable foundation system. If you only want to know what happens while
your computer boots, then we recommend the
<quote>From Power Up To Bash Prompt</quote> HOWTO. The HOWTO builds a bare
system which is similar to that of this book, but it focuses strictly on
creating a system capable of booting to a BASH prompt.</para>

<para>While you decide which to read, consider your objective. If you wish
to build a Linux system while learning a bit along the way, then this book
is probably your best choice. If your objective is strictly educational and
you do not have any plans for your finished system, then the
<quote>From Power Up To Bash Prompt</quote> HOWTO is probably a better choice.</para>

<para>The <quote>From Power Up To Bash Prompt</quote> HOWTO is located at
<ulink url="http://www.netspace.net.au/~gok/power2bash/"/>.</para>
