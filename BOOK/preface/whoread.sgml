<title>Who would want to read this book</title>

<para>
This book is intended for Linux users who want to learn more about the
inner workings of Linux and how the various pieces of the Operating
System fit together. This book will guide you step-by-step in creating
your own custom build Linux system from scratch, using the source code of 
the software that we need.
</para>

<para>
This book is also intended for Linux users who want to get away from the
existing commercial and free distributions that are often too bloated.
Using existing distributions also forces you to use the file system
structure, boot script structure, etc. that they choose to use. With
this book you can create your own structures and methods in exactly the
way you like them (which can be based on the ones this book provides)
</para>

<para>
Also, if you have security concerns, you don't want to rely on
pre-compiled packages. So instead, you want to compile all programs
from scratch and install them yourself. That could be another reason why 
you would want to build a custom made Linux system.
</para>

<para>
Those are just a few out of many reasons why people want to build their
own Linux system. If you're one of those people, this book is meant for
you.
