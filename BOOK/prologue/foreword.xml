<para>Six years ago I embarked on the adventure known as Linux. I did
what most you guys have done: download a distribution, install it, and
work with it for a while. Then you don't quite like it and you hear
about a different distribution that is supposed to be great and fix
everything your current distribution does wrong. So you try that new
distribution out for a while. You may even repeat that same cycle a
few times.</para>

<para>After you have tried out a number of different distributions,
you find that each has its strengths and weaknesses, but you can't
seem to find that one system that brings you the most satisfaction.
Personally, I came to the conclusion that to be truly satisfied with
my Linux system, I would have to somehow combine those different
systems into one <quote>perfect</quote> Linux system. It would then
have all the strengths from various different systems, without their
weaknesses.  But that surely is an impossible and daunting task. Or is
it?</para>

<para>You can do better than simply combining several distributions
into one.  You can create your own Linux system from scratch.</para>

<para>After figuring out things like circular dependencies, compile
time errors and other related issues, a custom built Linux system was
created and fully operational. I called this system a Linux From
Scratch system, or LFS for short. This book will show you how it was
done and how you can create your own LFS system, fully customized to
your own needs and desires.</para>

<para>I hope you will have a great time working on your own LFS!</para>
