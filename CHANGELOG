n/a - March 19, 2004

	* Renamed mountproc to mountkernfs
	* Updated the README file
	* Coloured the print_error_message in functions red
	* added stop to the setclock script
	* changed echo > to > in cleanfs, suggested by winkie
	* Initial additions of some BLFS Scripts
	* Edited killproc, so it checks for running pids, rather then
	  the completion of the above kill command.  Suggested by Zack

1.99.4 - March 17, 2004

	* Fixed one last halt line in checkfs script
	* Moved the directory structure around
	* Tagged as development release 1.99.4

n/a - February 28, 2004

	* Added stty sane to the top of rc.d/init.d/rc.  Hopefully, this will
	  fix the problems
	* Also changed all instances of <ctrl-j> back to enter

1.99.3 - February 23, 2004

	* Tagged as development release 1.99.3

n/a - February 19, 2004

	* Fixed checkfs script, so it will no longer continue to boot after a
	  failure in the init.d/checkfs script.  Tested with the help of Andre
	  Müller.  Fix suggested by Zack

n/a - February 7, 2004

	* Added -s onto grep on network stop
	* Replaced a few more enter's with ctrl-j

1.99.2 - February 6, 2004

	* Added -s onto grep in network start
	* Tagged as development release 1.99.2

n/a - February 4, 2004

	* Fixed $WARNING $NORMAL and $ERROR lines, broken by changes in
	  functions
	* Changed above fixes to work with ash
	* Fixed checkfs symlink in Makefile
	* functions is no longer installed as executable
	* Added a check to checkfs, for errors above 16.  These are caused by
	  being unable to run fsck, either due to user input, or a unfunctional
	  linux system

1.99.1 - February 2, 2004

	* Tagged as development release 1.99.1

n/a - February 2, 2004:

	* Added -d to umount in mountfs.
	* Fixed network shutdown script
	* Fixed Makefile rc.6 to reboot
	* Added -s flag to grep command in rc.d/init.d/network -
          suppresses an error if no ifconfig.* files exist

n/a - January 30, 2004:

	* Reorganized the network system to accept multiple services.
	* Ash Compliancy
	* Modified some scripts to follow template
	* Reorganized functions, based upon Ash Compliancy Patch
	* Added a sleep 5 to failure for evaulate_retval, and changed
	  evaulate_retval to return true instead of false.  Instead, a
	  exit 1 will indicate the script terminated abnormally, causing
	  your system to wait until you hit ctrl-J
	* Switched "Press enter to continue" to "Press <ctrl-j> to continue"
	* replaced 3 with $KILLDELAY in sendsignals
	* mountfs does not mount network filesystems [identified by _netdev
	  in /etc/fstab]
	* removed unneded touch out of cleanfs

n/a - January 30, 2004:

	* New maintainers for the lfs-bootscripts package are:
	Jeremy Utley (jeremy@linuxfromscratch.org)
	Nathan Coulson (nathan@linuxfromscratch.org)

1.11 - February 3rd, 2003:

	* /etc/mtab is now a real file and is handled correctly so there are
	no errors even when the machine has crashed.

1.10 - September 12th, 2002:

	* Fixed up checkfs to work with non-ext2 filesystems too (such as
	minix).

1.9 - April 5th, 2002:

	* reloadproc function had a missing '=' in the "failure 1" command (it
	  should be failure=1)

	* When script exists with unexpected value, you have to hit "Enter" to
	  continue, not just a random key as printed on the screen.

	* Moved K10sysklogd, K20sendsignals, K30mount and K40swap to
	  K40sysklogd, K50sendsignals, K60mount, K70swap

	* Changed the #!/bin/sh lines to #!/bin/bash - /bin/sh may not be
	  linked to bash but to some other shell of your choice. These scripts
	  are written to work with bash, so you can't just run them when
	  /bin/sh -> csh or ash or whatever else tickles your fancy. This
	  change should fix that.

1.8 - March 14th, 2002:

	* Fixed the getpids function call so PPID's would be taken into account
	  properly.

	* Added the 'contrib' directory with other people's bootscript
	  implementations.

1.7 - March 10th, 2002:

	* Used code from Matthias Benkmann's simpleinit-msb @
	  http://winterdrache.de/linux/newboot/index.html mainly for improved
	  killproc function handling

	* When a requested process isn't running, or is already running, a
	  warning "Not running" or "Already running" will be displayed. This
	  was out of allignment due to a missing $CURS_UP

	* Removed "||exit" from ifup and ifdown scripts. They are useless.

	* Changed the loadkeys script to run "loadkeys -d" and removed the need
	  for the /etc/sysconfig/keyboard file. The kbd patch fixes the
	  "loadkeys -d" behaviour.

1.6 - February 26th, 2002:

	* replaced -o %PPID with -o $PPID throughout the functions script. This
	construct does what it's supposed to do (don't take PPID into account
	because this would fail if a running daemon and the bootscript have
	the same name).

	* added 'restart' to the swap script

	* instead of using 'echo -n' to supress newlines so the [ OK ] and
	  related messages allign properly, substitute this with a single echo
	  command that simply goes one line up before outputting anything. This
	  also has the benefit that when programs have their own output (like
	  swapon, fsck and loadkeys), there won't be an unwanted blank line
	  between the program's output and the [ OK ] et all. messages.

1.5 - February 2nd, 2002:

	* added 'exit 1' to the statusproc function when there aren't enough
	parameters passed to it (such as the name of process to check for)

1.4 - February 2nd, 2002:

	* when /fastboot is detected and the message about it is printed,
	  don't run 'exit 1' else the rc script will cause a [FAILED] to
	  be printed which is undesired in this case.

1.3 - January 30th, 2002:
	* network script: changed default route detection by using the same
	  method as used when starting the script: check if the GATEWAY
	  variable is set

	* removed the emptying of /etc/mtab since it's a symlink to
	 /proc/mounts now

	* added the mountproc script which mounts the proc system. This is done
	  because we need proc mounted even before the mountfs script is ran
	  (now that /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts)

	* removed all absolute paths from command calls

	* added umask 022 and PATH="/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin" to the
	  functions script. Every file now sources this so that umask and PATH
	  are set correctly

1.2 - January 26th, 2002:
	* network script: detect if a default route is set before removing it
