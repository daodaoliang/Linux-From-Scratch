<question><para>Why not use GRUB instead of LILO?</para></question>
<answer><para>GRUB will very likely replace LILO in the book
when it reaches a stable release.
If you'd like to see that happen, bug the GRUB maintainers,
since current releases seem perfectly stable.
</para>
<para>If your current setup uses GRUB or you'd like to use it anyway,
you should have no trouble following the GRUB documentation
and the LFS "GRUB-Howto" Hint at
<ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/grub-howto.txt"/>.
