<question><para>No such file or directory</para></question>
<answer><para>Examples of this error are:
<screen>/usr/bin/env: /static/bin/bash: No such file or directory
gcc: No such file or directory
</screen></para>
<para>They usually occur when trying to enter
(or shortly after entering) chroot in Chapter 6,
and are caused by trying to run a dynamically linked binary at that point.
You can check by running file on the binary.
For example:
<screen>file $LFS/static/bin/bash</screen>
If it doesn't say something about "statically linked",
there is a problem.
</para>
<para>The solution is to go back to Chapter 5
and recompile the affected package.
And this time, take extra care with the instructions
for compiling it statically.
