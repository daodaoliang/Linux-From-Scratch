<answer><para>You're most likely getting this while building bash in Chapter 5
of the LFS Book.
The problem is most likely your mount options.
You probably have a line in /etc/fstab like:
<screen>/dev/hda10	/mnt/lfs	ext2	user	1  2
</screen>
'user' is the mount flag, and it's the problem. To quote from the mount man page:
<blockquote><screen> 
user  Allow  an  ordinary  user to mount the file system.
      This  option  implies  the options noexec,  nosuid,
      and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options,
      as in the option line user,exec,dev,suid).
</screen></blockquote>
So change the line in /etc/fstab like this:
<screen>/dev/hda10	/mnt/lfs	ext2	defaults	1  2
</screen>
</para></answer>
