<question><para>modprobe: Can't locate module
char-major-10-135</para></question>
<answer><para>"char-major-10-135" refers to the character device,
major 10, minor 135, which is /dev/rtc.
It provides access to the BIOS clock, or RTC, the Real Time Clock.
See /usr/src/linux/Documentation/rtc.txt for more information.
</para>
<para>The error is because something, most likely hwclock,
is trying to use /dev/rtc
but you haven't configured kernel support for it in your kernel.
Either delete /dev/rtc so hwclock won't try to use it
or enable RTC support in your kernel.
It's located in make menuconfig under
"Character devices" -&gt; "Enhanced Real Time Clock Support".
