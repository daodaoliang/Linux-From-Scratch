<question><para>configure can't guess my host type.</para></question>
<answer><para>Typical symptoms look like this:
<screen>sk ~/tmp-0.0 $ ./configure 
creating cache ./config.cache
checking host system type... <emphasis role="strong">configure: error: can not guess host type; you must specify one</emphasis>
sk ~/tmp-0.0 $
</screen></para>
<para>The problem is usually that the script can't run the compiler.
Usually it's just a missing /usr/bin/cc symlink. You can fix it like this:
<screen>cd /usr/bin
ln -s gcc cc
</screen></para>
<para>If that doesn't do it, check the file config.log created by configure.
Errors go there and may indicate the problem.
