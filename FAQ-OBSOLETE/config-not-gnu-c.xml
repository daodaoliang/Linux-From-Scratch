<question><para>checking whether we are using GNU C... no</para></question>
<answer><para>If you're getting an error from configure like:
<screen>checking whether we are using GNU C... no
configure: error: GNU libc must be compiled using GNU CC
</screen>
It may be because egrep (from the grep package) isn't working.
</para>
<para>To test if egrep is working <emphasis>before</emphasis> reinstalling
the grep package in Chapter 6,
run the following command from <emphasis>outside</emphasis> chroot:
<screen>file $LFS/bin/egrep
</screen>
If it doesn't say "statically linked" you have a problem
and need to reinstall the grep package.
</para>
<para>To test if egrep is working <emphasis>after</emphasis> reinstalling
the grep package in Chapter 6,
run the following command from <emphasis>inside</emphasis> chroot:
<screen>egrep root /etc/passwd
</screen>
If it doesn't print root's line from /etc/passwd,
again, you have a problem.
(This test also works if you encounter the problem after rebooting
into the new LFS system.)
