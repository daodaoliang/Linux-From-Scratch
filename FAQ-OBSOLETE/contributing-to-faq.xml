<answer><para>Suggestions are more than welcome.
The FAQ maintainer can be reached either via direct email
or on the appropriate mailing list.
</para>
<para>Useful suggestions include the addition of questions
that are actually frequently asked -- with well researched answers --
and the removal of questions that are obsolete.
</para>
<para>Serious, regular contributors are also welcome.
If you're interested in doing this,
you'll need to check the FAQ out of LFS CVS just like you would the book,
and modify the DocBook XML source.
Those modifications would normally be submitted as patches
generated with "diff -Naur",
but for simple additions which mostly involve the addition of a single file,
it may be simpler just to send the new file.
</para>
<para>Everything intended to go in the FAQ without substantial editing
must be well thought out, checked, and researched;
and written in a style consistent with the existing content.
