<question><para>How do I cross compile LFS?</para></question>
<answer><para>It's often useful to compile LFS for one machine
on another machine.
Say using that fast 1Ghz Athlon to build an install for an old 486.
While this is technically not cross compiling,
binaries compiled for the Athlon cannot be run on the 486
because binaries compiled for the newer processor
use features the older processor doesn't have.
To make the newer system compile for the older, follow the hint at
<ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/crosscompiling-x86.txt"/>.
