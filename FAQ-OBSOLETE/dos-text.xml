<question><para>What's a DOS format text file?</para></question>
<answer><para>It has to do with the characters used to end lines.
</para>
<para>There are two that may be used:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Line Feed: (LF) Octal:012 Decimal:10 Hex:0A C Style Escape:'\n'
Moves down one line.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Carriage Return: (CR) Octal:015 Decimal:13 Hex:0D C Style Excape:'\r'
Move to the left margin.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>Unix, DOS, and MacOS each use a different combination to end lines in text files:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Unix: LF only.
This is why when a Unix format text file is sent to a printer raw, it prints out
<screen>like
    stairs
          steps.
</screen>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>DOS: CRLF both.
Which is why if you do "cat -v" on a DOS file you'll see a "^M"
(control m is carriage return) at the end of each line. And that
is why scripts don't work when written with Microsoft Notepad.
The kernel looks for "/bin/sh^M" which doesn't exist. There's a
"/bin/sh", but nothing with a "^M" appended.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>MacOs: CR only.
Printers probably print every line atop the first, and Unix tools
think the whole file is one line with "^M" all through it.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
</para>
<para>To change DOS to Unix, use
<screen>cp &lt;filename> &lt;filename>.dos && cat &lt;filename>.dos | tr -d '\r' > &lt;filename>
</screen>
Other conversions will probably require sed or a different use of tr
and are left as an exercise for the reader.
