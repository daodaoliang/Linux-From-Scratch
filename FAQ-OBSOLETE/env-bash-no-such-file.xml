<answer><para>You're trying to follow the LFS Book
and working on entering chroot, right?
Most likely $LFS/bin/bash isn't statically linked.
Check it with:
<screen>file $LFS/bin/bash
</screen>
If that doesn't say something about "statically linked",
reinstall bash following the instructions in Chapter 5.
