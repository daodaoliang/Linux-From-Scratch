<answer><para>You need to install the net-tools package.
(See the instructions in the LFS book.)
</para>
<para>The hostname command your system is using is from sh-utils
and doesn't support the -f option.
When it is called with the -f option it assumes
the hostname should be set to "-f".
The hostname command from net-tools doesn't have this problem.
