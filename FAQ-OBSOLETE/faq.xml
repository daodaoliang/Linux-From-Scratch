		<qandaentry><question><para>Why this FAQ?</para></question>
			<answer><para>I started this FAQ in an attempt to make the traffic on
				the LFS mailing lists more manageable and improve the signal
				to noise ratio. I'm going to limit myself to things that come
				up often there leaving tips and such for
				<ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org">LFS-Hints</ulink>.

		</qandaentry>
		<qandaentry><question><para>What is appropriate for lfs-support?</para></question>
			<answer><para>From the
				<ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mailinglists/info.shtml">website</ulink>:
			</para>
			<blockquote>
				<para>The lfs-support mailing list provides support to users
					building an LFS system as far as the end of the main book.
					Requests for help with installing software beyond the base
					system should go to the blfs-support list.
				</para>
			</blockquote>
			<para>For instance, GCC and Glibc are part of the LFS book and
				belong on lfs-support.
				XFree86, KDE, and GNOME are not part of the LFS book and
				belong on blfs-support.

		<qandaentry><question><para>Contributing to this FAQ.</para></question>
			<answer><para>If you have an addition or suggestion, please, let me know.
				I can be reached at
				<ulink url="mailto:sk@sethwklein.net">sk@sethwklein.net</ulink>,
				and i read the lists thoroughly (but not always promptly).

			<answer><para>I want to stick to questions that have been asked at least

		<qandaentry><question><para>Where is the best place to get help?</para></question>
			<answer><para>When this FAQ fails to help, there are several places to go.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para>If you're having a problem with something in the book,
				it never hurts to go back over the book.
				It's surprising how easy it is to overlook little things.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para>If nothing else,
				reading the appropriate man and info pages
				will yield useful information on some subject,
				if not what you were looking for,
				and insure that you know enough not to embarrass yourself
				if you have to ask someone.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para><ulink url="http://www.linuxdoc.org/">http://www.linuxdoc.org/</ulink>
				has the HOW-TOs and a great deal of other documentation.
				You might find something there.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para>The linuxfromscratch.org site search includes the mailing lists.
				Many questions have been discussed there at least once.  It's at
				<ulink url="http://search.linuxfromscratch.org/">http://search.linuxfromscratch.org/</ulink>.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para>For support type help, IRC is often best. It's faster,
				and doesn't clog the mailinglists.
				Information on the LFS IRC channel is at
				<ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/irc.shtml">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/irc.shtml</ulink>.
			</para></answer>
			<answer><para>As a last resort, there are the mailing lists.
				People will get frustrated with you if you use the wrong one or cross post.
				Mailing list information is at
				<ulink url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mailinglists/info.shtml">http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mailinglists/info.shtml</ulink>:
				and tells which list to use.
			</para></answer>
		</qandaentry>
		<qandaentry><question><para>What is LFS?</para></question>
			<answer><para>LFS stands for Linux From Scratch which is a project that
				primarily documents how to install a Linux system by downloading,
				building, and installing the packages yourself.
			</para>
			<para>For why you might want to do this, how to do it, and other
				useful stuff, see the website at

		<qandaentry id="cross-compile"><question><para>How do I cross compile LFS?</para></question>
			<answer><para>It's often useful to compile LFS for one machine
				on another machine. Say using that 1Ghz Athlon
				to build an install for an old 486.
				While this is technically not cross compiling,
				binaries compiled for the Athlon cannot be run on the 486
				because binaries compiled for the newer processor
				use features the older processor doesn't have.
				To make the newer system compile for the older,
				follow the hint at <ulink

		<qandaentry id="gcc-warnings"><question><para>Are compiler warnings from GCC bad?</para></question>
			<answer><para>Short answer: no.

				working on the package you're trying to compile. Mostly,
				everything will be fine unless make quits with an error.

			<para>Here's an example:
			</para>
			<screen>sk ~/tmp $ cat > Makefile

	gcc main.c
sk ~/tmp $ cat > main.c
void main() { exit(0); }

		<qandaentry id="perm-denied"><question><para>I'm getting `/dev/null: Permission denied'</para></question>
			<answer><para>Does /dev/null look like this:
				<screen>$ ls -l /dev/null
crw-rw-rw-   1 root     root       1,   3 Aug  3  2000 /dev/null
				</screen>
				If so, the problem is probably your mount options.
				You probably have a line in /etc/fstab like:
				<screen>/dev/hda10	/mnt/lfs	ext2	user	1  2
				</screen>
				`user' is the mount flag, and it's the problem. To quote from
				the mount man page:
				<blockquote><screen> 
user  Allow  an  ordinary  user to mount the file system.
      This  option  implies  the options noexec,  nosuid,
      and nodev (unless overridden by subsequent options,
      as in the option line user,exec,dev,suid).
			</screen></blockquote>
				So change the line in /etc/fstab like this:
				<screen>/dev/hda10	/mnt/lfs	ext2	defaults	1  2

sk ~/tmp-0.0 $

			<para>The problem is usually that the script can't run the compiler.
				Usually it's just a missing /usr/bin/cc symlink. You can fix it like
				this:
			</para>
			<screen>cd /usr/bin
ln -s gcc cc

			<para>If that doesn't do it, check the file config.log created by configure.

		<qandaentry id="optimized-glibc-fail"><question><para>My optimized build of glibc is failing in spinlock.c</para></question>
			<answer><para>I should mention that glibc (and gcc and binutils)
				are good places to not optimize.
				The performance versus stability trade off is unusually poor
				for these packages. But. . . .

		<para>LFS is a very basic system, in massive contrast to traditional

			allow you to build your system from it. It's not an end, it's
			a beginning. When you're done with LFS, you've just started
			building your system.
