<para>LFS is a very basic system,
in massive contrast to traditional distributions. The reason is this:
LFS is not intended to create your system as you want it.
It's intended to be just enough to allow you
to build your system as you want it.
It's not an end, it's a beginning.
When you're done with LFS, you've just started building your system.

<para>This can be a problem if you're new to Unix systems
and want a typical desktop install with X and a web browser
but have no idea what packages you need.
For this reason, there is Beyond Linux From Scratch, or BLFS.
It's at <ulink url="http://beyond.linuxfromscratch.org/"/>.
