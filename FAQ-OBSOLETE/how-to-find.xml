<question><para>How do I find a package or command?</para></question>	
<answer><para>Mostly, it's not hard, but some things can lead quite a chase.
</para>
<para>To get a command, you must know what package it's from.
Sometimes this is obvious;
when it's not, a search on
either <ulink url="http://www.debian.org/distrib/packages#search_contents"/>
or <ulink url="http://www.rpmfind.net"/>
will usually provide the answer.
</para>
<para>Once you know the package,
searching <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/"/> for
<screen>foo</screen>
will usually turn up a freshmeat page
with links to an URL
which may have newer releases not reported to freshmeat.
</para>
<para>Searching <ulink url="http://www.google.com/"/> for 
<screen>+foo +index +lsm</screen>
tends to find directory listings with an LSM (Linux Software Map) file.
The LSM file will list an official distribution point
which is likelier to have the most recent version
or at least a more recent LSM file
which will list an even more recent distribution point.
</para>
<para>If the search results are clogged
with links to RPM packages and Debian's archives, try
<screen>+foo +index +lsm -RPM -debian</screen>
If there are too few results try dropping the "+lsm" and "+index".
</para>
<para>Hits on <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/"/> are often good.
To find them specifically, use
<screen>foo site:ibiblio.org</screen>
</para>
<para>If the latest release is old,
Debian or an SRPM may have helpful patches,
and there may be a modern replacement for the package
which a freshmeat search will likely find.
