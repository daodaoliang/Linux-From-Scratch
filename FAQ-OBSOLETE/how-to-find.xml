<question><para>How do I find package Foo?</para></question>	
<answer><para>Mostly, it's not hard, but some packages can lead quite a chase.
</para>
<para>Searching <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/"/> for
<screen>foo</screen>
will usually turn up a freshmeat page
with links to an URL
where which may have newer releases not reported to freshmeat.
</para>
<para>Searching <ulink url="http://www.google.com/"/> for 
<screen>+foo +index +lsm</screen>
tends to find directory listings with an LSM (Linux Software Map) file.
The LSM file will list an official distribution point
which is likelier to have the most recent version
or at least a more recent LSM file
which will list an even more recent distribution point.
</para>
<para>If the search results are clogged
with links to RPM packages and Debian's archives, try
<screen>+foo +index +lsm -RPM -debian</screen>
If there are too few results try dropping the "+lsm" and "+index".
</para>
<para>Hits on <ulink url="http://www.ibiblio.org/"/> are often good.
To find them specifically, use
<screen>foo site:ibiblio.org</screen>
</para>
<para>If the latest release is old,
Debian or an SRPM may have helpful patches,
and there may be a modern replacement for the package
which a freshmeat search will likely find.
