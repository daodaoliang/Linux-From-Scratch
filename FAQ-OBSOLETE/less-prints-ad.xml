<question><para>Why does less (and therefore man) print &lt;AD&gt; instead of
hyphens?</para></question>
<answer><para>Because the LANG and LC_ALL environment variables aren't set.
To fix that, set them in the ~/.bashrc file for each user or in /etc/profile
by adding lines like this:
<screen>export LANG=en_US
export LC_ALL=en_US
</screen>
</para>
<para>Those lines can be added to /etc/profile with the following command:
<screen>echo -e 'export LANG=en_US\nexport LC_ALL=en_US' >> /etc/profile
</screen>
</para>
<para>You'll have to change the "en_US" part if you don't use US English.
