<question><para>I'm getting errors about net-pf-?.</para></question>
<answer><para>When you compiled net-tools
you enabled support for a protocol family (that's where the "pf" comes from)
that you didn't enable support for in the kernel.
(You probably just accepted the default answers.)
</para>
<para>A full list of protocols is in /usr/include/linux/socket.h
but here is a list of the likely culprits:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>net-pf-3: Amateur Radio AX.25 (AF_AX25)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>net-pf-4: Novell IPX (AF_IPX)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>net-pf-5: AppleTalk DDP (AF_APPLETALK)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>net-pf-6: Amateur Radio NET/ROM (AF_NETROM)
</para></listitem>
<listitem><para>net-pf-9: Reserved for X.25 project (AF_X25)
</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist></para>
<para>Naturally the fix is to recompile net-tools
without support for the things you don't need.
(Or recompile your kernel with support if you find you actually wanted them.)
The workaround to put a line like the following in /etc/modules.conf
</para>
<screen>alias net-pf-? off
</screen>
<para>Replace the question mark with the correct number, of course.
And rerun depmod.
</para></answer>
<answer><para>If you get an error about net-pf-7,
you probably need to enable support for the loopback network device
(not block device) in your kernel.
Or you may need to add the following line to /etc/modules.conf and rerun depmod.
</para>
<screen>alias net-pf-7 loop
</screen></answer>
