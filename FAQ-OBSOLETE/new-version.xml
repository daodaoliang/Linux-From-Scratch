<answer><para>If you'd like to report a new release of a package,
here's how:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Check the <ulink url="http://freshmeat.net/">freshmeat</ulink>
page for the project to see if it has been updated.
If it hasn't, report the new release there
and the automated freshmeat announcements will report it to the LFS lists.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If freshmeat has been updated,
check the list
<ulink url="http://archive.linuxfromscratch.org/mail-archives/">archives</ulink>
to see if freshmeat (or someone else)
has reported it to lfs-book (or blfs-book for packages in BLFS).
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If no one has reported it to the lists,
check <ulink url="http://bugs.linuxfromscratch.org/">LFS bugzilla</ulink>
(or <ulink url="http://blfs-bugs.linuxfromscratch.org/">BLFS bugzilla</ulink>)
to see if it's there.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If it's not in bugzilla,
report it to lfs-book (or blfs-book for packages in BLFS).
And if you like, test the new release and report any problems
or changes in compilation instructions, too.
</para></listitem>
