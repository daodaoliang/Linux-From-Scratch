<question><para>I'm using optimizations.
Can that be a problem?</para></question>
<answer><para>If you're getting errors and you're using optimization settings,
that may be the problem.
If you ask on the list and they can't figure it out immediately,
they'll likely suggest trying it without optimizations,
so just retry it without before asking.
You'll be one step ahead of them :)
</para>
<para>Optimizations can cause many different
even seemingly unrelated errors.
They can cause configure scripts to fail.
Optimizations that work for someone else
may not work for you. Settings that used to work may break
if you make the smallest, most innocent hardware change.

<para>(If you don't know what optimization settings are,
don't worry, really you don't need to.)
