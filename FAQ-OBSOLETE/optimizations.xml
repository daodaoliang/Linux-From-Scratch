<question><para>When using optimization flags (setting CFLAGS)</para></question>
<answer><para>If you're getting errors
and you're setting CFLAGS
or otherwise passing optimization flags to the compiler
that may be the problem.
</para>
<para>If you ask on the list and they can't figure it out immediately,
they'll likely suggest trying it without optimization.
So if you just retry it without before asking,
you'll be one step ahead of them :)
</para>
<para>Of particular note is that optimizing binutils, gcc, or glibc
may cause any other package to fail to compile or run
or to otherwise misbehave in strange and mysterious ways.
Also, optimization that works for someone else may not work for you.
Flags that used to work may mysteriously stop working.
Even some small innocent hardware change can make the difference.
</para>
<para>(If you don't know what optimization flags are,
don't worry, you really don't need to.)
