<question><para>You LFSers play Quake?!?</para></question>
<answer><para>Glad you asked ;)
Ian Molton in the UK runs a Quake server for LFS users.
Here are details:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Players need the latest Quake 3 release.
As of February, 2003, this is 1.32b from
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/quake3/linux/linuxq3apoint-1.32b.x86.run"/>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Players need the pak0.pk3 file from the full game of Quake 3.
This is available on the Quake 3 CD (even the MS Windows version).
It goes in /usr/local/games/quake3/baseq3/
unless you installed Quake 3 somewhere else.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Players need the add on maps used in the server
which they can get from <ulink url="http://games.mnementh.co.uk/"/>
and install in ~/.q3a/baseq3/ or where ever the pak0.pk3 file is.
Downloading the maps manually is absolutely necessary
because the server has automatic map downloading disabled.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>For the same reason that automatic map downloading is disabled,
please don't download from the web while a game is in progress.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Although the server is only guarenteed to be running
when games are scheduled,
players may connect to the server for testing whenever they like.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Games are held every week
on Tuesday at 20:00 UTC
and on Saturday at 22:00 UTC.
Note that those times are in UTC.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Because the server is only for LFS users,
and Ian would like to avoid setting a password,
the server name is recorded only in the lfs-chat archives.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you've created an entry for the server in your "favorites"
but it's not showing up,
you may have "Show empty servers" turned off.
