<question><para>The system shuts down when fsck errors out!</para></question>
<answer><para>Unix systems normally run sulogin
if the normal bootup fsck run errors out
so that root can log in and fix it.
Because sulogin will accept any password if /etc/passwd is corrupt,
the LFS developers decided this was a security risk.
Therefore, the LFS bootscripts shut the machine down if fsck errors,
and it must be booted with the "init=/bin/bash" kernel parameter
to get a root shell.
Whether this is wise is beyond the scope of the FAQ,
but if it doesn't work for you
you'll want to change that boot script before it's too late.
