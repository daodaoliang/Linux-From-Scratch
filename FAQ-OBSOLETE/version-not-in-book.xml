<question><para>I'm using a version not in the book.
Is that a problem?</para></question>
<answer><para>If you're getting errors and you're using a version of
a package that differs from the version in the book
(either newer or older), try the version in the book.
Sometimes there are reasons why the book uses a particular version.
Search the list archives if you're curious.
