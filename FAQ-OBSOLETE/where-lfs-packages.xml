<answer><para>For bandwidth reasons,
the lfs-packages tarball is no longer available.
This is subject to change,
but for now, packages can be downloaded in bulk via the wget script found at
<ulink url="http://linuxfromscratch.org/~highos/packages-ordered.wget"/>.
The wget(1) man page tells how to use that script.</para>
