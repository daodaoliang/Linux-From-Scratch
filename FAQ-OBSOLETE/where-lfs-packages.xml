<answer><para>For bandwidth reasons,
the lfs-packages tarball is no longer available.
This is subject to change,
but for now, packages can be downloaded in bulk via a wget script.
For LFS 4.1 there is:
<ulink url="http://linuxfromscratch.org/~highos/packages-ordered.wget"/>,
and for LFS CVS there is
<ulink url="http://archive.linuxfromscratch.org/mail-archives/lfs-support/2003/05/att-0492/01-lfs-cvs-20030516.wget"/>.
The wget(1) man page tells how to use those scripts.</para>
