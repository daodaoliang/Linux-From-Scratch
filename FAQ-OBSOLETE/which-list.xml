<question><para>Which list should I use for what topic?</para></question>
<answer><para>The full answer is at <ulink
url="http://www.linuxfromscratch.org/mailinglists/info.shtml"/>,
but here is a summary:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>Send <emphasis>support</emphasis>
questions to only
lfs-<emphasis role="strong">support</emphasis>
and blfs-<emphasis role="strong">support</emphasis>.
Questions like "How do I..." and "I'm getting this error..."
or anything else requesting help go to the
support lists and no where else.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>If you are not having trouble following
the <emphasis>LFS</emphasis> Book itself,
do <emphasis>not</emphasis> email
<emphasis role="strong">lfs</emphasis>-support.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Unless you are
<emphasis>suggesting an improvement</emphasis> to the LFS Book itself,
do not email lfs-dev.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Only suggestions concerning the BLFS Book
are acceptable on blfs-dev.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Things are a little different with blfs-support.
Everything that doesn't fit one of the preceding lists fits there except for
the price of beer and GNU versus BSD flamewars.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The price of beer, GNU versus BSD,
and Microsoft versus Linux flamewars are restricted to lfs-chat.
These days, hardware discussion should go there as well.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
Of special note is that if you mention XFree86, KDE, or GNOME
you may be sure that your post does not belong on lfs-dev or lfs-support.
