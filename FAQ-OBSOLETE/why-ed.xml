<question><para>Why is ed in the book?</para></question>
<answer><para>The book includes ed because patch uses it to process ed scripts.

<para>But ed does have other uses:
<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>For all who've learned to use it,
ed is a very useful emergency editor.
The MS Windows standard telnet client can deal with ed
but has trouble with fullscreen editors (like vim).
And a full featured vim requires not only ncurses, but X11 as well!
Any trouble with those libraries will leave
the system without an editor if ed isn't present.

<listitem><para>Though it's not a reason to have ed in the book,
some people actually like ed.

<listitem><para>Understanding ed helps with understanding vi(m) and Unix
history in general.
