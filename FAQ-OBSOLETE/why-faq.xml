<question><para>Why this FAQ?</para></question>
<answer><para>The FAQ tries to answer questions before they're asked.
This saves the trouble of asking them,
and sometimes, the trouble of encountering a problem.
</para>
<para>This does reduce traffic and improve the signal to noise ratio
but that is merely a useful side effect.
</para>
<para>Since the FAQ isn't the natural place to look for information,
items should be added to it
only if they can't be added to the appropriate documentation,
although sometimes it will be necessary to add a pointer
to the information in the documentation.
</para></answer>
