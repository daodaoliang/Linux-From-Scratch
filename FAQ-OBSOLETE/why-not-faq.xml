<answer><para>Marc Heerdink may have said it best in a post to lfs-dev:
<blockquote><para>The problem is that the FAQ is a dynamic document.
The FAQ for a book release is released only after the book version itself,
because the FAQ is updated to reflect the Qs asked
about the current version of the book.
A link is better, since you'll always have the most up-to-date answers handy.
