<question><para>Why not upgrade LILO to the latest version?</para></question>
<answer><para>For now, the book is staying with LILO 22.2
because versions of LILO after 22.2 require nasm.
While there should be no problem installing nasm,
the book and many users are reluctant to install an extra package just for LILO.
Many users are switching to GRUB.
(The book would probably switch to GRUB
if the GRUB maintainers made a release they called stable.
You could bug the GRUB maintainers if you'd like to see this happen.)
