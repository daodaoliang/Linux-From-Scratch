<question><para>Why isn't some package manager in the book?</para></question>
<answer><para>Package management -
beyond that profided by tarballs and makefiles -
is beyond the scope of the book.
If nothing else does,
the number of different "solutions" should hint at some of the reasons.
</para>
<para>Here are a few of the options:
<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>No package management is really necessary.
Unless it is desirable to monitor package file placement minutely,
any package large enough to warrent removal for disk space reasons
can be installed in /opt as detailed by the FHS.
Libraries are generally best upgraded by rebuilding the system
from the bottom up.

<listitem><para>RPM, the Redhat Package Manager,
is used by a number of distributions.
It is available from
<ulink url="http://www.rpm.org/"/>,
and there is an RPM Hint to help with installation at
<ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/rpm.txt"/>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>GNU Stow is an interesting concept. See
<ulink url="http://www.gnu.org/software/stow/"/>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Originally based on a script
written by LFS' own Gerard Beekmans,
install-log records a list of files installed by a package
as the package is installed.
It is available from
<ulink url="http://install-log.sourceforge.net/"/>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Gerard has since made additions to his script.
It is available from
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/pkginst"/> and
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/pgkdel"/>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>CheckInstall attempts log system calls made by
"make install". It is available from
<ulink url="http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/"/>.
</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>
Do you know of one missing from that list?
Please email its name, URL, and other information,
to the FAQ maintainer or an apropriate LFS mailing list so it can be added here.
