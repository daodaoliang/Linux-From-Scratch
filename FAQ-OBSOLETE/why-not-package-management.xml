<question><para>Why isn't some package manager in the book?</para></question>
<answer><para>Package management -

<para>Here are a few of the options:

<listitem><para>No package management is really necessary.
Unless it is desirable to monitor package file placement minutely,
any package large enough to warrent removal for disk space reasons
can be installed in /opt as detailed by the FHS.
Libraries are generally best upgraded by rebuilding the system
from the bottom up.

<listitem><para>RPM, the Redhat Package Manager,
is used by a number of distributions.
It is available from
<ulink url="http://www.rpm.org/"/>,
and there is an RPM Hint to help with installation at
<ulink url="http://hints.linuxfromscratch.org/hints/rpm.txt"/>.
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>There are several implementations of the Depot/Stow/Encap
style package manager.
