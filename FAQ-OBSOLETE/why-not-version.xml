<question><para>Can I use a version newer

<answer><para>If this is your first time building LFS,
using a version not in the book or varying from the book in any way
is not a good idea.
The IRC channel regulars have a saying, "FBBG".
As rms, the resident bot, is quick to say,
this means, "Follow Book, Book Good."
They and the people on the lists have helped many an unhappy newbie
who deviated from the book during that first build.

<para>Once you've built a system "by the book",
you have a stable knowledge base from which to
experiment to your heart's content
(or pain, as is often the case.)

<para>To help you on your travails, err travels,
here are some notes for specific releases:

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>flex-2.5.31:
This release is nasty. Word in #lfs-support has it that it will work with
XFree86 4.3.0.1, the latest HJL binutils, and using "flex -l" with modutils,
which can be done with <ulink
url="http://evanidus.ath.cx:8080/l14h/patches/personal/modutils-2.4.25-flex-2.5.31-tmp-fix.patch.bz2"/>
You will also encounter problems with libidl, and perhaps more.
You're on your own if you try this.
Don't expect any support.
Version 2.5.27 is more likely to work without weird hacks.
<!-- Chris on #lfs-support says the patch doesn't work
See <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=720971&amp;group_id=72099&amp;atid=533377"/>
for a description of the problem,
and <ulink
url="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/index.php?func=detail&amp;aid=720976&amp;group_id=72099&amp;atid=533379"/>
for a patch that fixes it.

<listitem><para>gcc-3.3:
Don't use this yet unless you're a developer and can fix errors
because it breaks many packages.
If you are a developer, you may find Jim Gifford's patches useful.
They're at
<ulink url="http://www.jg555.com/projects/patches/ftpdownload/"/>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>glibc-2.3.2:
Add to your build instructions:
<screen>touch /etc/ld.so.conf &amp;&amp;
ln -s /static/bin/pwd /bin/pwd &amp;&amp;
touch /usr/include/assert.h &amp;&amp;
</screen>
</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>bash-2.05b:
Apply the patches from
<ulink url="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/bash/bash-2.05b-patches/"/>
and configure the static (Chapter 5) build with --without-bash-malloc.
