<answer><para>If this is your first time building LFS,
using a version not in the book or varying from the book in any way
is not a good idea.
The IRC channel regulars have a saying, "FBBG".
As Tux, the resident bot, is quick to say,
this means, "Follow Book, Book Good."
They and the people on the lists have helped many an unhappy newbie
who deviated from the book during that first build.

<para>Once you've built a system "by the book",
you have a stable knowledge base from which to
experiment to your heart's content
(or pain, as is often the case.)
