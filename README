How do I convert these XML files to other formats like HTML, PDF, PS
and TXT? You need to have some software installed that deal with these
conversions. Please read the INSTALL file how to install that software.
Then come back to this file for examples how to convert these files
into various other formats.

XML to HTML:
------------
Create a directory in which you want to store the HTML files and cd into 
that directory. Now run:
	/usr/bin/openjade -t sgml \
		-d /usr/share/dsssl/docbook/html/lfs.dsl \
		/usr/share/dsssl/docbook/dtds/decls/xml.dcl \
		/path/to/intel.xml

While openjade is running you will see a lot of the following kind of
errors:

/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:6:19:E: "X00E1"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:7:19:E: "X00C1"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:8:18:E: "X00E2"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:9:18:E: "X00C2"
is not a function name
/usr/bin/openjade:/usr/share/docbook/ent/iso-lat1.ent:10:19:E: "X00E0"
is not a function name

They are normal in the sense of that it doens't affect the output
files. A fix hasn't been found yet so we'll just have to live with it.


XML to NOCHUNKS-HTML:
--------------------
The NOCHUNKS HTML version is one big HTML file:
	/usr/bin/openjade -t sgml \
		-V nochunks \
		-d /usr/share/dsssl/docbook/html/lfs.dsl \
		/usr/share/dsssl/docbook/dtds/decls/xml.dcl \
		/path/to/intel.xml > nochunks.html

XML to TXT:
-----------
First create the NOCHUNKS HTML file, then convert by running:
	/usr/bin/lynx -dump nochunks.html > output.txt

XML to PDF:
-----------
First create the NOCHUNKS HTML file, then convert by starting
/usr/bin/htmldoc. Personally I use the htmldoc GUI. It's easier to use
than the slew of command line options you can use.

In the GUI, click on the "Add Files..." button on the Input tab and
select the NOCHUNKS HTML file. Then click the "PDF" button on the
Output tab and enter the output file name in the "Output Path" box.
If you don't want to change other options, click on the "Generate"
button and wait a few seconds.

XML to PS:
----------
First create the NOCHUNKS HTML file, then convert by starting
/usr/bin/htmldoc. Personally I use the htmldoc GUI. It's easier to use
than the slew of command line options you can use.
 
In the GUI, click on the "Add Files..." button on the Input tab and
select the NOCHUNKS HTML file. Then click the "PS" button on the
Output tab and enter the output file name in the "Output Path" box.
If you don't want to change other options, click on the "Generate"
button and wait a few seconds.
