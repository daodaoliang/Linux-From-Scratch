 - Mention --enable-kernel=... where appropriate.
 - Create and use the 'utmp' group, and explain to the user how to use it to
   improve the security of things that write to utmp, such as terminal
   emulators.
 - Move passwd to /bin.
 - Mention --enable-multibyte when building vim.
 - POSIX compliance patches (aka, removing the coreutils hack).
 - Upgraded to a glibc that supports POSIX message queues.
 - Pass --enable-const to ncurses.
 - Readline in Ch.6, and add uses of it. For example, Bash accepts the
   --with-external-readline (or something like that) argument, and E2fsprogs
   can be more "interactive" when compiled w/ a patch against it.
