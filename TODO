These are the TODO items for the next LFS release (3.0):

1) second chroot command, chapter 6 glibc, fix up -> must by identical
  to first chroot command in chapter 6

2) Chapter 5 fileutils, gcc, linux: instead of for example:
	ln -s ../../bin/install install
  change it to
	ln -s ../../bin/install
  This just shortens the command a bit and it looks better.

3) Chapter 5, gcc: change the title

4) Chapter 5, gzip: don't pass --disable-nls - it has no function on
  the gzip package

5) Chapter 5, tar: remove prefix=$LFS/usr from the 'make install'

6) Chapter 5, mawk: instead of putting -static in CFLAGS which is sloppy
  sed the Makefile to add an LDFLAGS variable similar to what we do
  with bzip2 in chapter 5

7) Chapter 5, makedev: instead of sed "s/.../.../" put the quotations
  marks inside the search reg ex (sed s/"..."/.../).

8) Chapter 5, makedev: cd to $LFS/dev first, then cp to makedev-temp and
  patch it.

9) Chapter 6, glibc: after copying pt_chown set mode 4755 on it (Glibc
  doesn't do this because it failed to copy pt_chown. It tried to chown
  root it which failed because glibc wasn't fully installed yet)

10) Chapter 5, bash: add note that when error occurs regarding
  install-info (on Debian systems for example) it can be safely
  ignored.

11) Chapter 5, kernel: Remove the exessive explanations. Just the
  commands in sequence like with any other package and explain below
 in the "command explanations"

12) Chapter 5, bash: when the 'install-info' error corrurs on Debian
  systems, check if this affects && (the message is Error 2 (ignored)
  but does that mean the return value is set to 0 as well...)

13) Check if findutils dumps binaries in /usr/local/bin

14) Try out latest shadow suite. If it fails with "nflg undefined" change
  this in useradd.c : line 1768:
	-if (! (nflg || gflg)) {
	+if (!gflg) {

15) Make a note that during the first reboot an error from sysklogd is
  normal due to missing /etc/services|protocols files which are
  installed when netkit-base is installed later on in chapter 9

16) Chapter 3: mention lfs-packages isn't for CVS

17) Fix the static link problems some distro's are causing

18) Clean out the ethnet script (for interface in $(ls 
  /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg* | grep -v ifcfg-lo)
  do) needs some updating for example)

19) Don't use \u in PS1 when entering chroot to avoid the 'i have no
  name'. After Glibc installation we could modify the PS1 (export
  PS1=newvalues) and test that way if glibc is working properly. This
  saves us the having to exit and re-end chroot environtment. Another
  idea is to run 'id' or 'whoami' after Glibc installation and check if
  it's able to find a matching username with root's id.

20) Instead of rm file && ln -s source dest, use ln -sf source dest

21) e2fsprogs apparently needs ldconfig. Check if there are other
  packages before e2fsprogs which use ldconfig when it's present

22) Mention more hints through out the books (like BSD hint before
  staring with chapter 7, devfs hint before running MAKEDEV, etc)

23) Fix the layout of intel/chapter7/usage.xml
 
24) Consider ftp://ftp.win.tue.nl/pub/linux-local/utils/kbd/
  to replace console-tools/console-data

25) Try new procps install:
	make OPT="$CFLAGS" INCDIRS='-I/usr/include -I.' XSCPT='' install	
26) When installing Glibc in chapter 6 the mtrace program isn't
  build. Find out why.

27) Incorporate LFS FAQ in the book

28) Full dependency list. This list isn't a list of "package a depends on
  package b", but a list of "package a depends on b and c from
  package d"

29) Bring the book up to speed with the current FHS specs.

30) Mention security patches that can be applied to packages.

31) Don't run lilo from inside chroot anymore. This causes severe problems
  sometimes including LILO not bootstrapping properly.

32) Bring back the PPC book (recreate from scratch using current intel
  book) using Jesse McCrosky's notes at
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/ppc-notes.txt
  and the patch to the 'patch' package at:
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/ppc-patch.patch

33) Add descriptions what the patches do we use (like the console-tools and 
    gzip patches)

34) Try out Slackware's MAKEDEV script and see if it's any better than the
  currently used one. A copy can be found at
  http://download.linuxfromscratch.org/misc/Slackware-MAKEDEV

35) Add netkit-base and net-tools to Appendix A.

36) Suggest using this command to strip debug symbols after you finish
  chapter 6: find $LFS -type f -exec strip --strip-debug '{}' ';'
