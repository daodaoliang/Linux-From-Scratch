 - Mention --enable-kernel=... where appropriate.
 - POSIX compliance patches (aka, removing the coreutils hack).
 - Pass --enable-const (and maybe --enable-widec) to ncurses.
 - Use that E2fsprogs patch to include Readline support in debugfs.
 - See about removing some things from Chapter 5, like patch. We can build
   those at the beginning of chapter 6 and have one less package to compile.
   We need to be sure this doens't break the pureness though.
 - Check for pureness and fix any occurrences of breakage.
 - Add more index terms to hotplug page.
 - Include the proclen patch for sysvinit, since it's really small, fixes a very
   noticable bug, and is all just around just play fun to look at.
 - Convert some patches to seds (only sane ones, though).
