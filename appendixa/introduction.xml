<para>This appendix describes the following aspects of every package
that is installed in this book:</para>

<itemizedlist>

<listitem><para>What the package contains.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>What each program from a package does.</para></listitem>

</itemizedlist>

<para>The packages are listed in the same order as they are installed in
chapter 5 and chapter 6.</para>

<para>Most information about these packages (especially the descriptions of
them) come from the man pages from those packages. We are not going to print
the entire man page, just the core elements to make it possible to
understand what a program does. To get knowledge of all details on a program, 
we suggest you start by reading the complete man page in addition to 
this appendix.</para>

<para>Certain packages are documented in more depth
than others, because we just happen to know more about certain
packages than I know about others. If anything should be added to the
following descriptions, please don't hesitate to email the mailing
lists.  We intend that the list should contain an in-depth description 
of every package installed, but we can't do it without help.</para>

<para>Please note that currently only what a package does is described and not
why it needs to be installed.  This may be added later.</para>
