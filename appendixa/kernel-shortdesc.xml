<para>The Linux kernel is at the core of every Linux system. It's what makes
Linux tick. When a computer is turned on and boots a Linux system, the
very first piece of Linux software that gets loaded is the kernel. The
kernel initializes the system's hardware components: serial ports, parallel
ports, sound cards, network cards, IDE controllers, SCSI controllers and a
lot more. In a nutshell the kernel makes the hardware available so that the
software can run.</para>
