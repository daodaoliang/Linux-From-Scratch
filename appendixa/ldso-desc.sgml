<para>
ldconfig creates the necessary links and cache (for use by the  run-time 
linker, ld.so) to the most recent shared libraries found in the directories 
specified on the command line, in the file /etc/ld.so.conf, and in the trusted
directories (/usr/lib and /lib). ldconfig checks the header and file names 
of the libraries it encounters when determining which versions should  
have their links updated.
