<sect2><title>Description</title>

<para>The less program is a file pager (or text viewer). It displays the
contents
of a file with the ability to scroll. Less is an improvement on the
common
pager called <quote>more</quote>. Less has the ability to scroll
backwards
through files as well and it doesn't need to read the entire file when
it
starts, which makes it faster when reading large files.</para>
