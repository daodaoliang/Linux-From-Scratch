<sect3><title>info</title>

<para>
The info program reads Info documents, usually contained in your
/usr/doc/info directory. Info documents are like man(ual) pages, but
they tend to be more in depth than just explaining the options to a
program.

<sect3><title>install-info</title>

<para>
The install-info program updates the info entries. When you run the info
program a list with available topics (ie: available info documents) will
be presented. The install-info program is used to maintain this list of
available topics. If you decice to remove info files manually, you need
to delete the topic in the index file as well. This program is used for
that. It also works the other way around when you add info documents.
