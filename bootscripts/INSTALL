Thank you for helping us test the new LFS-bootscripts package!

Before you install this, there's something you should know.  Our
initial testing was that this package would work as a drop-in on
any LFS system, however, that may not be the case.  Please read the 
README file, as it contains important information about the new
structure of the bootscripts. We would like to know if you encounter
any problems, so we may address them for the future.  Please send 
E-mail to either jeremy@linuxfromscratch.org or nathan@linuxfromscratch.org 
with your feedback.

Now, on to the installation:

First, remove the old LFS-bootscripts package - this is quite simple:

rm -rf /etc/rc.d/*

Now, install the new bootscripts package - we've simplified this with
a standard Makefile:

make install

That's it!  You should be able to safely reboot your system at this
time!


Don't forget to send us feedback, and hit these all you want!
