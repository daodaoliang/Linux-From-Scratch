The below applies to the original lfs-bootscripts. You can find the latest
scripts in conglomeration/ [1] directory at the Linux From Scratch [2] site.

What?

Instead of executing the files (symbolic links) from /etc/rc.d/rc*.d
directories, the script uses the variables STOP[runlevel] and START[runlevel]
(sysinit as runlevel 7) and executes the scripts found in them. The scripts
are executed in order of appearance.

Why?

Personally, I find it much easier to simply edit a few variables in a single
file, then to manage links in multiple directories and worry about their order
using numbers.

How?

  * Copy the rc file over your old one.
  * Edit the variables found inside it.
  * Remove your /etc/rc.d/rc*.d directories, if you want to.
