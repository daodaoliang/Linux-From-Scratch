Having used a number of different Linux distributions, I was never fully
satisfied with any of those. I didn't like the way the bootscripts were
arranged, I didn't like the way certain programs were configured by
default, and more of those things. I came to realize that if I wanted to
be fully satisfied with a Linux system, I would have to build my own system 
from scratch, ideally using only the source code. Not using 
pre-compiled packages of any kind. No help from some sort of CD-ROM or 
bootdisk that would install some basic utilities. I would use my current 
Linux system and use that one to build my own.

This, at one time, wild idea seemed very difficult and at times almost
impossible. After sorting out all kinds of dependency problems, compile
problems, etcetera, a custom-built Linux system was created and fully 
operational. I called this system an LFS system, which stands for Linux 
From Scratch.
