The lfs-announce list is a moderated list. You can subscribe to it, but
you can't post any messages to this list. This list is used to announce
new stable releases. If you want to be informed about development
releases as well, then you'll have to join the lfs-discuss list. If
you're already on the lfs-discuss list, there's little use subscribing to
this list as well because everything that is posted to the lfs-announce
list will be posted to the lfs-discuss list as well.
