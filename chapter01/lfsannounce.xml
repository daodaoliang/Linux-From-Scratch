<para>The lfs-announce list is a moderated list. It can be subscribed to, but
you can't post any messages to this list. This list is used to announce
new stable releases. The lfs-dev list will carry information about
development releases as well. If a user is already on the lfs-dev 
list, there's little use subscribing to
this list as well because everything that is posted to the lfs-announce
list will be posted to the lfs-dev list as well.</para>
