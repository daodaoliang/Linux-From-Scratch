<title>Download the LFS Commands</title>

<para>
LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book. These files can be
used to dump to a shell and install the packages, though some files 
need to be modified (for example, when the kbd package is 
installed, you needed to select the keyboard layout file, becaue it can't 
reliably be guessed).
</para>

<para>
These files can also be used to quickly find out which commands have been
changed between the different LFS versions as well. Download the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book version 
and run a diff on the files. That way it is possible to see which packages
have updated installation instructions, so any scripts you may have can 
be modified, or you can reinstall a package if you think that
necessary.
