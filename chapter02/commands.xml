<para>LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book.</para>

<para>These files can be used to quickly find out which commands have
been changed between the different LFS versions. Download the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book
version and run a diff on the files. That way it is possible to see which
packages have updated installation instructions, so any scripts you may 
have can be modified, or you can reinstall a package if you think that
necessary.</para>

<para>A side effect is that these files can be used to dump to a shell and 
install the packages, though some files need to be modified (where
certain settings can't be guessed and depend on user preference or
system hardware). Keep in mind, please, that these files are not
thoroughly checked for correctness. There may be bugs in the files (since 
they are manually created at the moment) so do check them and don't 
blindly trust them.</para>

<para>If you decide to use the commands to automatically install a
package and it doesn't work, try reading the book's instructions
instead before you ask for help on the mailinglist.</para>
