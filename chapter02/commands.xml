<title>Download the LFS Commands</title>

<para>
LFS Commands is a tarball containing files which list the installation
commands for the packages installed in this book. These files can be
used to dump to a shell and install the packages, though some files 
need to be modified (for example when the console-tools package is 
installed it is needed to select the keyboard layout file which can't be
guessed).
</para>

<para>
These files can be used to quickly find out which commands have been
changed between the different LFS versions as well. A user just downloads the
lfs-commands tarball for this book version and the previous book version 
and run a diff on the files. That way it is possible to see which packages
have 
updated installation instructions and he can modify his own scripts, or 
reinstall a package if it seems necessary.
