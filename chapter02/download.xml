<para>Throughout this document, we will assume that all the
packages that were downloaded are placed somewhere in $LFS/usr/src.</para>

<para>While it doesn't matter at all where you save the downloaded
packages, we recommend storing it at least on the LFS partition. This just
makes sense because you would still have access to those files when you boot
into the LFS system. $LFS/usr/src is just a logical place to store source
code, but by no means a requirement. You may even want to create a
subdirectory under $LFS/usr/src for tarball storage. That way you can
separate tarballs from temporary build directories, but again that's up
to you.</para>

<para>The next chapter contains a list of all the packages that need to be
downloaded. The LFS partition isn't created yet, so you can't store it
there yet. Just save it elsewhere for now, and when the LFS partition is
created, move them over.</para>
