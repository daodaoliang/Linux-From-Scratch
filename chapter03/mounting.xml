<title>Mounting the new partition</title>

<para>
Now that we have created the ext2 file system, it is ready for use. All we have
to do to be able to access it (as in reading from and writing date to it) is
mounting it. If it is mounted under /mnt/lfs, this partition can be accessed 
by going to the /mnt/lfs directory and then doing whatever needed to do. This
book will assume that the partition was mounted on a subdirectory
under /mnt. It doesn't matter which directory is chosen, the user just has 
to make sure
that he remembers what he chose.

<para>
Create the /mnt/lfs directory by runnning:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>mkdir -p /mnt/lfs</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Now mount the LFS partition by running:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>mount /dev/xxx /mnt/lfs</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
Replace <quote>xxx</quote> by the partition's designation.
</para>

<para>
This directory (/mnt/lfs) is the $LFS variable I have written about earlier.
So if the user somewhere reads to "cp inittab $LFS/etc" he actually will type
<quote>cp inittab /mnt/lfs/etc</quote>. Or if he wants to use the $LFS
environment variable, <userinput>export LFS=/mnt/lfs</userinput> has to be 
executed now.  </para>
