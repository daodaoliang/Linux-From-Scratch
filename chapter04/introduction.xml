<para>Below is a list of all the packages that are needed to download for 
building the basic system. The version numbers printed correspond to versions of
the software that is known to work and which this book is based on. 
If you 
experience problems which you can't solve yourself, then please download the
version that
is assumed in this book (in case you downloaded a newer version).</para>

<para>If the packages.linuxfromscratch.org server isn't allowing connections
anymore try one of our mirror sites. The addresses of the mirror sites 
can be found in <ulink url="ch01-version.html">Chapter 1 - Book 
Version</ulink></para>

<para>We have provided a list of official download sites of the packages below
in <ulink url="appendixc.html">Appendix C - Official download locations
</ulink>. The LFS FTP archive only contains the versions of packages 
that are recommended for use in this book. You can check the official
sites in Appendix C to determine whether a newer package is available.
If you do download a newer package, we would appreciate hearing
whether you were able to install the package using this book's
instructions or not.</para>

<para>Please note that all files downloaded from the LFS FTP archive are files
compressed with bzip2 instead of gz. If you don't know how to
handle bz2 files, check out

software</ulink>.</para>
