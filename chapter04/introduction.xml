Below is a list of all the packages that are needed to download for building
the basic system. The version numbers printed correspond to versions of
the software that is known to work and which this book is based on. 
If the user 
experiences problems which he can't solve himself, he should download the
version that
is assumed in this book (in case he downloaded a newer version).

We have provided a list of official download sites of the packages below
in <ulink url="appendixc.html">Appendix C - Official download locations
</ulink>. The LFS FTP archive only contains the versions of packages 
that are recommended for use in this book. Newer versions than the ones
listed here might be found after having a look in Appendix C.

<para>
Please note that all files downloaded from the LFS FTP archive are files
compressed with bzip2 instead of gz. If the user does not know how to
handle bz2
files, he should read <ulink url="ch02-install.html">Chapter 2 - How to install
the software</ulink>.
