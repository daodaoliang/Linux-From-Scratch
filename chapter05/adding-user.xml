<title>Adding the user lfs</title>

<para>When logged in as <emphasis>root</emphasis>, making a single mistake
can damage or even wreck your system. Therefore we recommend that you
build the packages in this chapter as an unprivileged user. You could
of course use your own user name,  but to make it easier to set up a clean
work environment we'll create a new user <emphasis>lfs</emphasis> and
use this one during the installation process. As <emphasis>root</emphasis>,
issue the following commands to add the new user:</para>

<screen><userinput>useradd -s /bin/bash -m lfs
passwd lfs</userinput></screen>

<para>Now grant this new user <emphasis>lfs</emphasis> full access to
<filename class="directory">$LFS/tools</filename> by giving it ownership
of the directory:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown lfs $LFS/tools</userinput></screen>

<para>If you made a separate working directory as suggested, give user
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> ownership of this directory too:</para>

<screen><userinput>chown lfs $LFS/sources</userinput></screen>

<para>Next, login as user <emphasis>lfs</emphasis>. This can be done via a
virtual console, through a display manager, or with the following substitute
user command:</para>

<screen><userinput>su - lfs</userinput></screen>

<para>The "<userinput>-</userinput>" instructs <userinput>su</userinput> to
start a new, clean shell.</para>
