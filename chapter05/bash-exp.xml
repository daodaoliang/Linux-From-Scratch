<para><userinput>--enable-static-link:</userinput> This configure 
option causes bash to be linked statically.</para>

<para><userinput>--prefix=$LFS/static:</userinput> This configure option
installs all of Bash's files under the $LFS/static directory, which becomes
the /static directory when chroot'ed or reboot'ed into LFS.</para>

<para><userinput>--with-curses:</userinput> This causes bash to be
linked against the curses library instead of the default termcap 
library which is becoming obsolete.</para>

<para>It is not strictly necessary for the static bash to be linked
against libncurses (it can link against a static termcap for the time
being just fine because we will reinstall Bash in Chapter 6 anyways,
where we will use libncurses), but it's a good test to make sure that
the Ncurses package has been installed properly. If not, you will get in
trouble later on in this chapter when you install the Texinfo package.
That package requires ncurses, and termcap can't reliably be used
there.</para>

<para>The <userinput>&amp;&amp;</userinput>'s at the end of every line cause 
the next command to be executed only if the previous command exits
with a return value of 0 indicating success. In case all of these 
commands are copy &amp; pasted on the shell, it is important to ensure
that if ./configure fails, make isn't executed and, likewise, if make
fails, that make install isn't executed, and so forth.</para>
