<para>then that means that you are probably using Debian-2.2 (potato), and 
that you have an old version of the texinfo package and the info pages
can't be installed at this time. This error is not a problem as the info
pages will be installed when we recompile bash dynamically in Chapter 6, so
you can ignore it.  It is reported that the current release of Debian
(3.0; also known as Woody) doesn't have this problem.</para>
