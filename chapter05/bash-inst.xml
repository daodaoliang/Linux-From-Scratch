<title>Installation of Bash</title>

<para>Before you attempt to install Bash, you have to check to make sure
your distribution has the <filename>/usr/lib/libcurses.a</filename> and
<filename>/usr/lib/libncurses.a</filename> files. If your host
distribution is an LFS system, all files will be present if you followed
the instructions of the book version you read exactly.</para>

<para>If both of the files are missing, you have to install the Ncurses
development package. This package is often called something like 
<emphasis>ncurses-dev</emphasis>. If this package is already installed,
or you just installed it, check for the two files again. Often the 
<filename>libcurses.a</filename> file is (still) missing. If so, then 
create <filename>libcurses.a</filename> as a symlink by running the 
following commands as user root:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s libncurses.a /usr/lib/libcurses.a</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now we can continue. Install Bash by running the following 
commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --enable-static-link \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--prefix=$LFS/static --with-curses &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If the <userinput>make install</userinput> phase ends with something
along the lines of this:</para>

<blockquote><screen>install-info: unknown option `--dir-file=/mnt/lfs/usr/info/dir' 
usage: install-info [--version] [--help] [--debug] [--maxwidth=nnn] 
	[--section regexp title] [--infodir=xxx] [--align=nnn] 
	[--calign=nnn] [--quiet] [--menuentry=xxx]
	[--info-dir=xxx] 
	[--keep-old] [--description=xxx] [--test]
	[--remove] [--] filename 
make[1]: *** [install] Error 1 
make[1]: Leaving directory `/mnt/lfs/usr/src/bash-&bash-version;/doc' 
make: [install] Error 2 (ignored)</screen></blockquote>

<para>then that means that you are probably using Debian-2.2 (potato), and 
that you have an old version of the texinfo package. This error is not 
severe by any means: the info pages will be installed when we recompile bash 
dynamically in Chapter 6, so you can ignore it.  It is reported that the
current release of Debian (3.0; also known as Woody) doesn't have this
problem.</para>
