<para><userinput>mkdir ../binutils-build:</userinput> The installation
instructions for Binutils recommend creating a separate build directory
instead of compiling the package inside the source tree. So, we create a
binutils-build directory and work from there.</para>

<para><userinput>--disable-nls:</userinput> This option disables
internationalization (also known as i18n). We don't need this for our
static programs and nls often causes problems when you're linking
statically.</para>

<para><userinput>LDFLAGS=-all-static:</userinput> Setting the variable LDFLAGS
to the value -all-static causes binutils to be linked statically.</para>
