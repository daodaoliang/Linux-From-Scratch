<title>Creating the $LFS/stage1 directory</title>

<para>All programs compiled in this chapter will be installed under <filename
class="directory">$LFS/stage1</filename> to keep them separate from the
programs compiled in the next chapter. The programs compiled here are only
temporary tools and won't be a part of the final LFS system and by keeping them
in a separate directory, we can later easily throw them away. Create the
required directory by running the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir $LFS/stage1</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The next step is to create a "/stage1" symlink on the host system. It
will point to the directory we just created on the LFS partition:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s $LFS/stage1 /</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This ensures our toolchain will look in the same place (i.e. /stage1)
in both Chapters 5 and 6 (when we are inside the chroot). This is an
important concept to grasp. Don't worry if it's not clear right now, all
will make sense once we get into Chapter 6.</para>
