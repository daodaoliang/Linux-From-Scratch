<title>Creating the $LFS/stage1 directory</title>
<?dbhtml filename="creatingstage1dir.html" dir="chapter05"?>

<para>All programs compiled in this chapter will be installed under <filename
class="directory">$LFS/stage1</filename> to keep them separate from the
programs compiled in the next chapter. The programs compiled here are only
temporary tools and won't be a part of the final LFS system and by keeping them
in a separate directory, we can later easily throw them away. Create the
required directory by running the following:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir $LFS/stage1</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The next step is to create a <filename>/stage1</filename> symlink on
your host system. It will point to the directory we just created on the LFS
partition:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s $LFS/stage1 /</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This symlink enables us to compile our toolchain so that it always
refers to <filename>/stage1</filename>, meaning that the compiler, assembler
and linker will work both in this chapter (when we are still using some tools
from the host) <emphasis>and</emphasis> in the next (when we are chrooted to
the LFS partition).</para>
