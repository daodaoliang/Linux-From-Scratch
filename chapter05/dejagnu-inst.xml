<para>This completes the testing tools. We can now rebuild GCC and Binutils
to link them against the new Glibc, and test them properly. One thing to note,
however, is that these test suites are highly dependent on the features
supported by your host distribution.  Most notably, a host distribution which 
does not properly support the devpts filesystem will cause most of these tests
to fail.</para>
