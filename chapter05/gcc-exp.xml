<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-3.0.patch:</userinput> This patch
changes all instances of re_max_failures to re_max_failures2.
re_max_failures is a variable used within Glibc and with static
compiling this variable sometimes clashes between the package's 
re_max_failures and the same variable in glibc. By renaming 
re_max_failures in the package to re_max_failures2 we just tell the 
package to use the second variable so that glibc won't be in the way.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-languages=c,c++:</userinput> This only builds the C
and C++ compilers and not the other available compilers as they are, on
the average, not often used. If those other compilers are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter can be omitted.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -s ../usr/bin/cpp:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/lib/cpp symlink. Some packages explicitly try to find
cpp in /lib.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -s ../bin/cpp:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/usr/lib/cpp symlink as there are packages that expect
cpp to be in /usr/lib.</para>
