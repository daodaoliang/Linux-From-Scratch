<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-&gcc-patch-version;.patch:</userinput>
This patch fixes a few bugs. In particular it contains the "copy fix" and
"var fix" documented at 
<ulink url="http://www.zipworld.com.au/~gschafer/lfs-tweaks.html"/>.</para>

<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-3.2-nofixincludes-2.patch:</userinput>
This prevents the fixincludes script from running.</para>

<para><userinput>--prefix=/static:</userinput> This is NOT a typo. GCC hard
codes some paths while compiling and so we need to pass /static as the
prefix during ./configure. We pass the real install prefix during the
make install command later.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-languages=c:</userinput> This builds the C
compiler. The C++ compiler will be built in Chapter 6, when we rebuild
GCC. Other compilers are available as well. If they are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter may be omitted.</para>

<para><userinput>echo "#define HAVE_GAS_HIDDEN 1":</userinput>
This defines the .hidden assembler directive so that we don't build
a faulty Glibc later on.</para>

<para><userinput>make BOOT_LDFLAGS=-static:</userinput>
This is the equivalent to make LDFLAGS=-static as we use with other
packages to compile them statically.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -s gcc $LFS/static/bin/cc:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/static/bin/gcc symlink, which some packages need.</para>
