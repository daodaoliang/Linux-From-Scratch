<para><userinput>make BOOT_LDFLAGS=-static:</userinput>
This is the equivalent to make LDFLAGS=-static as we use with other
packages to compile them statically.</para>

<para><userinput>--prefix=/static:</userinput> This is NOT a typo.  GCC hard
codes some paths while compiling and so we need to pass /static as the
prefix during ./configure.  We pass the real install prefix during the
make install command later.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-languages=c:</userinput> This builds the C
compiler. The C++ compiler will be built in chapter 6, when we rebuild
GCC. Other compilers are available as well. If they are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter may be omitted.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-threads=posix:</userinput> This enables C++ 
exception handling for multithreaded code.</para>

<para><userinput>ln -s gcc $LFS/static/bin/cc:</userinput> This
creates the $LFS/static/bin/gcc symlink which some packages need.</para>
