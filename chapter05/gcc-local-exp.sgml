<para>
<userinput>--with-local-prefix:</userinput> GCC installs a number of
files in /usr/local even when --prefix is set to something else. We
don't want that to happen in this case so that's why we use the
--with-local-prefix option to change that path.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>--with-gxx-include-dir:</userinput> GCC installs the C++
header files in /usr/include/g++ by default. Again, in this case we
don't want that to happen, we want this GCC version to be installed
completely under /usr/local/gcc2952.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>make bootstrap:</userinput> Compile GCC by bootstrapping it.
Here that means the compiler will be built three times in total. First
it is compiled with your system's default compiler (which will usually
be a gcc or egcs compiler). This is stage 1 compiler. Then GCC will re-compile 
itself but instead of using your system's compiler it will use itself to 
compile itself again. This is the stage 2 compiler. Then it will compile 
itself a second time with the stage 2 compiler and compares the second 
and the third build to see if they are identical. If so, the
compilation was a success.
