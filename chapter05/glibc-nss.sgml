<title>Copying old NSS library files</title>

<para>
If your normal Linux system runs glibc-2.0, you need to copy the NSS
library files to the LFS partition. Certain statically linked programs
still depend on the NSS library, especially programs that need to lookup
usernames,userid's and groupid's. You can check which C library version
your normal Linux system uses by running:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>strings /lib/libc* | grep "release version"</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
The output of that command should tell you something like this:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>
	GNU C Library stable release version 2.1.3, by Roland McGrath et al.
</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
If you have Glibc-2.0.x installed on your starting distribution, copy 
the NSS library files by running:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cp -av /lib/libnss* $LFS/lib</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>
