<title>Installation of Grep</title>

<para>Prepare Grep to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/tools \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--disable-perl-regexp --with-included-regex</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The meaning of the configure switches:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para><userinput>--disable-perl-regexp</userinput>: This makes sure
that grep does not get linked against a PCRE library that may be present on
the host, but would not be available once we enter the chroot environment.</para></listitem>
<listitem><para><userinput>--with-included-regex</userinput>: This ensures that
grep uses it's internal regular expression code.  Without it, it will use
the code from glibc, which is known to be slightly buggy.</para></listitem>
</itemizedlist>

<para>Compile the programs:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make </userinput></screen></para>

<para>This package has a testsuite available which can perform a number of 
checks to ensure it built correctly.  Should you choose to run it, the 
following command will do so:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Then install them and their documentation:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>
