<title>Installation of Gzip</title>

<para>Before Gzip is installed, the patch file may need to be applied.  This 
patch file is necessary to avoid a conflict of variable names
with Glibc-2.0 systems when compiling and linking statically and so is
only required if your base system runs Glibc-2.0.  It is however
safe to apply the patch even if you are running a different glibc
version, so if you aren't sure, it's best to apply it.</para>

<para>Apply the patch by running the following command:</para>

<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gzip-&gzip-version;.patch</userinput></para>

<para>Install Gzip by running the following commands:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/usr &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>make install &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>cp $LFS/usr/bin/gunzip $LFS/usr/bin/gzip $LFS/bin &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>rm $LFS/usr/bin/gunzip $LFS/usr/bin/gzip</userinput></screen></para>
