<para><userinput>make mrproper:</userinput> This will ensure that the kernel
tree is absolutely clean.</para>

<para><userinput>yes "" | make config:</userinput> This runs make config and
answers with the default answer to every question the config script asks 
the user (it does this by simply doing the equivalent of hitting the
Enter key, thus accepting the default Y and N answers to the questions). 
We're not configuring the real kernel here, we just need to have some sort 
of configure file created so that we can run make dep next that will 
create a few files in $LFS/usr/src/linux/include/linux, like version.h, 
among others, that we will need to compile Glibc and other packages later 
in chroot.</para>

<para><userinput>make dep:</userinput> make dep checks dependencies and sets
up the dependencies file. We don't really care about the dependency
checks, but what we do care about is that make dep creates those
aforementioned files in $LFS/usr/src/linux/include/linux we will be
needing later on.</para>

<para><userinput>cp -a ../src/linux/include/linux .</userinput> and
<userinput>mkdir asm &amp;&amp; cp -a ../src/linux/include/asm/*
asm</userinput>:
These commands copy the kernel headers in the 
<filename>$LFS/usr/include</filename> directory.</para>

<para><userinput>chown -R root.root $LFS/usr/include/linux</userinput> and 
<userinput>chown -R root.root $LFS/usr/include/asm</userinput>:
These commands change the ownership of the 
<filename>$LFS/usr/include/linux</filename> and the 
<filename>$LFS/usr/include/asm</filename> directories, plus all the
files contained therein to the user root and group root.</para>
