<title>Installation of the kernel headers</title>

<para>As some packages need to refer to the kernel header files, we're going
to unpack the kernel archive now, set it up, and copy the required files to a
place where <userinput>gcc</userinput> can later find them.</para>

<para>Prepare for the header installation with:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make mrproper</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This ensures that the kernel tree is absolutely clean. The kernel team
recommends that this command be issued prior to <emphasis>each</emphasis> kernel
compilation. You shouldn't rely on the source tree being clean after
untarring.</para>

<para>Create the <filename>include/linux/version.h</filename> file:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make include/linux/version.h</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Create the platform-specific <filename>include/asm</filename>
symlink:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make symlinks</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install the platform-specific header files:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mkdir /stage1/include/asm
cp include/asm/* /stage1/include/asm
cp -R include/asm-generic /stage1/include</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install the cross-platform kernel header files:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp -R include/linux /stage1/include</userinput></screen></para>

<para>There are a few kernel header files which make use of the
<filename>autoconf.h</filename> header file. Since we do not yet configure the
kernel, we need to create this file ourselves in order to avoid compilation
failures. Create an empty <filename>autoconf.h</filename> file:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>touch /stage1/include/linux/autoconf.h</userinput></screen></para>
