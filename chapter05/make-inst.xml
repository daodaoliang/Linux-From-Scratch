<title>Installation of Make</title>

<para>Prepare Make to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>LDFLAGS="-static" ./configure --prefix=$LFS/static --disable-nls</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Continue with compiling the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And finish off installing the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install phase you will see this warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>chgrp: changing group of `/mnt/lfs/static/bin/make': Operation not permitted
/mnt/lfs/static/bin/make needs to be owned by group kmem and setgid;
otherwise the `-l' option will probably not work. You may need special
privileges to complete the installation of /mnt/lfs/static/bin/make.</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore this warning. The <userinput>make</userinput>
program doesn't actually need to be owned by group kmem and setgid for the
<emphasis>-l</emphasis> option to work. (This option tells
<userinput>make</userinput> not to start any new jobs when a certain load
on the system has been reached.)</para>
