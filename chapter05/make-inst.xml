<title>Installation of Make</title>

<para>Install Make by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/usr --disable-nls &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install phase you will see this warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>chgrp: changing group of `/mnt/lfs/usr/bin/make': Operation not permitted
/mnt/lfs/usr/bin/make needs to be owned by group kmem and setgid;
otherwise the `-l' option will probably not work. You may need special
privileges to complete the installation of /mnt/lfs/usr/bin/make.</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore this warning. make doesn't need to be owned by
group kmem and setgid for the <emphasis>-l</emphasis> option to work (which
you can use to tell make not to start any new jobs when a certain load on
the system is reached).</para>
