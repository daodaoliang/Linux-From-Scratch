<title>Installation of Sh-utils</title>

<para>Install Sh-utils by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/usr --disable-nls &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
cd $LFS/usr/bin &amp;&amp;
mv basename date echo false hostname $LFS/bin &amp;&amp;
mv pwd sleep stty test true uname $LFS/bin &amp;&amp;
mv chroot ../sbin</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install stage you will see the following warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>WARNING: insufficient access; not installing su
NOTE: to install su, run 'make install-root' as root</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore that warning. You need to be logged in as root
in order to install su the way sh-utils wants to install it, that being
suid root. Because we don't need su during chapter 6, and su will be properly
installed when we re-install sh-utils in chapter 6 anyways, you can just
pretend you didn't see it.</para>
