<title>Installation of Sh-utils</title>

<para>Install Sh-utils by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=$LFS/static \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;--disable-nls &amp;&amp;
make LDFLAGS=-static &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>During the make install stage you will see the following warning:</para>

<blockquote><screen>WARNING: insufficient access; not installing su
NOTE: to install su, run 'make install-root' as root</screen></blockquote>

<para>You can safely ignore that warning. You need to be logged in as root
in order to install su the way Sh-utils wants to install it, which is being
suid root. Because we don't need su during chapter 6, and su will be properly
installed when we re-install Sh-utils in chapter 6, you can just
pretend you didn't see it.</para>
