<title>Installation of TCL</title>

<para>This package and the next two are only installed to be able to run the
test suites for GCC and Binutils. Installing three packages just for for
testing purposes may seem like overkill, but it is very reassuring, if not
essential, to know that our most important tools are working properly.</para>

<para>Prepare Tcl to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd unix
./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Build, the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This package has a testsuite available which can perform a number of 
checks to ensure it built correctly.  Should you choose to run it, the 
following command will do so:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>TZ=UTC make -k test</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Sometimes, package testsuites will give false failures.  You can
consult the LFS Wiki at <ulink url="http://wiki.linuxfromscratch.org"/>
to verify that these failures are normal.  This applies to all tests
throughout the book.</para>

<para>Install the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Make a link:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>ln -s tclsh8.4 /tools/bin/tclsh</userinput></screen></para>

<caution><para>Do not remove the
<filename>tcl&tcl-version;</filename> source directory yet, as the next package
will need its internal headers.</para></caution>
