<title>Installation of TCL</title>

<para>This package and the next two are only installed to be able to run the
test suites for GCC and Binutils. Installing three packages just for for
testing purposes may seem like overkill, but it is very reassuring, if not
essential, to know that our most important tools are working properly.</para>

<para>Prepare Tcl to be compiled:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cd unix
./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Build, test, and install the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make 
make -k test
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Note that several of the tests may fail (for exmple the clock test).
This is, however, not a problem: the program will work well enough to be able
to run the GCC and Binutils test suites.</para>

<para>Make a link:</para>
<para><screen><userinput>ln -s tclsh8.4 /tools/bin/tclsh</userinput></screen></para>

<caution><para><emphasis>Do not remove</emphasis> the
<filename>tcl&tcl-version;</filename> source directory yet, as the next package
will need its internal headers.</para></caution>
