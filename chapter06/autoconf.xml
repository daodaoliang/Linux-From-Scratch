<title>Installation of Autoconf</title>

<para>Prepare Autoconf for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which performs a number of
checks to ensure it will function correctly. It's worth noting that Autoconf
does not play a critical role in the overall operation of an LFS system. In
addition, the Autoconf test suite runs for quite a long period of time.
Accordingly, the running of the test suite here is not crucial. Should you
choose to run the Autoconf test suite, the following command will do
so:</para>

<screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
