<title>Creating $LFS/root/.bash_profile</title>

<para>When we have entered the chroot'ed environment in the next section we
want to export a couple of environment variables in that shell such as
PS1, PATH and others variables which are good to have set. For that
purpose we'll create the $LFS/root/.bash_profile file which will be read 
by bash when we enter the chroot environment.</para>

<para>Create a new file <filename>$LFS/root/.bash_profile</filename>
by running the following.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cat &gt; $LFS/root/.bash_profile &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
# Begin /root/.bash_profile

PS1='\u:\w\$ '
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin

export PS1 PATH

# End /root/.bash_profile
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen></para>

<para>The PS1 variable is an environment variable that controls the appearance 
of the command prompt. See the bash man page for details how this variable
is constructed. Additional environment variables, aliases and so forth that are
needed and/or wanted can be added at your own discretion.</para>
