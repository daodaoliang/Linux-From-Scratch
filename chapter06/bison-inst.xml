<title>Installation of Bison</title>

<para>First we use a patch to bison, backported from CVS, which fixes a minor
compilation problem with some packages:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../&bison-patch;</userinput></screen>

<para>Prepare Bison for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/usr</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>This package has a test suite available which can perform a number of
checks to ensure it built correctly.  Should you choose to run it, the 
following command will do so (and takes a long time):</para>

<screen><userinput>make check</userinput></screen>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
