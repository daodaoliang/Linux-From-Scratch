<para><userinput>make -f Makefile-libbz2_so:</userinput> This will cause bzip2
to be built using a different Makefile file, in this case the
Makefile-libbz2_so file which creates a dynamic libbz2.so library and
links the bzip2 utilities against it.</para>

<para>The reason we don't use <userinput>make install</userinput> is that
bzip2's make install doesn't install the shared libbz2.so, nor the bzip2
binary that's linked against that library. So we have no choice but to
manually install the files.</para>
