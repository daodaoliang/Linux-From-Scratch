<para>Now we're in chroot, it is time to change the ownership of
the files and directories that were installed in chapter 5 to root.
Run the following command to do so:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>chown -R 0:0 /</userinput></screen></para>

<para>This command changes the ownership of the root partition to
root. The command uses 0:0 instead of root:root, because the user name
"root" can't be resolved, as glibc is not installed yet.</para>
