<title>Entering the chroot'ed environment</title>

<para>
It's time to enter our chroot'ed environment in order to install the
rest of the software we need.
</para>

<para>
Enter the following command to enter the chroot'ed environment. From
this point on there's no need to use the $LFS variable anymore, because
everything a user does will be restricted to the LFS partition (since / is
actually /mnt/lfs but the shell doesn't know that).
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cd $LFS &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>chroot $LFS /usr/bin/env -i HOME=/root
		\</userinput>
	<userinput>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;TERM=$TERM /bin/bash --login</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
The TERM=$TERM construction will set the $TERM value inside
chroot to the same value as outside chroot which is needed for programs
like vim and less to operate properly.
</para>

<para>
Now that we are inside a chroot'ed environment, we can continue to
install all the basic system software. A user has to make sure all the
following commands in this and following chapters are run from within the 
chroot'ed environment. If he ever leaves this environment for a reason
(say when rebooting or something) he has to remember to mount $LFS/proc again 
like he did earlier and to re-enter chroot before continuing with the
book.
</para>

<para>
Note that the bash prompt will contain "I have no name!". This is
normal; Glibc hasn't been installed yet.
