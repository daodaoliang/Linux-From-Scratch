<sect2><title>Configuring Shadow Password Suite</title>

<para>
This package contains the utilities to modify user's passwords, add new
users/groups, delete users/groups and more. I'm not going to explain to you
what 'password shadowing' means. You can read all about that in the doc/HOWTO
file within the unpacked shadow password suite's source tree. There's one 
thing you should keep in mind, if you decide to use shadow support, that 
programs that need to verify passwords (examples are xdm, ftp daemons, 
pop3 daemons, etc) need to be 'shadow-compliant', eg. they need to
be able to work with shadow'ed passwords.
</para>

<para>
Shadow'ed passwords are not enabled by default. Simply installing the
shadow password suite does not enable shadow'ed passwords.
</para>

<para>
Now is a very good moment to read chapter 5 of the doc/HOWTO file. You can
read how you can enable shadow'ed passwords, how to test whether shadowing 
works and if not, how to disable it again.
</para>

<para>
The documentation mentions something about the creation of npasswd and
nshadow after you run pwconv. This is an error in the documentation.
Those two files will be be created. After you run pwconv, /etc/passwd
will no longer contain the passwords and /etc/shadow will. You don't
need to rename the npasswd and nshadow files yourself.
