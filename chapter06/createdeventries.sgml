<title>Creating the /dev entries</title>

<para>
Create the device files by running the following commands:
</para>

<blockquote><literallayout>

	<userinput>cd /dev &amp;&amp;</userinput>
	<userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic</userinput>

</literallayout></blockquote>

<para>
The <quote>generic</quote> parameter passed to the MAKEDEV script
doesn't create all the devices you might need, such as audio devices,
hdc, hdd and ohters. If you seem to be missing something tell MAKEDEV to
create it. To create hdc replace generic with hdc. You can also add hdc
to generic, so you would execute <userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic
hdc</userinput> to create the generic set of devices files, plus the
files you need to be able to access hdc (and hdc1, hdc2, etc)

Please note that this script dates back from 1997 and therefore can be
outdated and not support newer hardware. If you need device files which
aren't known by this script please read the Documentation/devices.txt
file in a Linux source tree. This file lists all the major and minor
numbers for all the device files that the kernel knows about. With this
list you can create such device files yourself. See the mknod man page
for more information on how to make device files yourself.
