<para>Let's now create the directory tree on the LFS partition based on
the FHS standard, which can be found at
<ulink url="http://www.pathname.com/fhs/"/>.
Issuing the following commands will create a default directory layout:</para>
 
<para><screen><userinput>mkdir -p /{bin,boot,dev/pts,etc/opt,home,lib,mnt,proc} &amp;&amp;
mkdir -p /{root,sbin,tmp,usr,usr/local,var,opt} &amp;&amp;
for dirname in /usr /usr/local
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;do
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir $dirname/{bin,etc,include,lib,sbin,share,src}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ln -s share/{man,doc,info} $dirname
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir $dirname/share/{dict,doc,info,locale,man}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir $dirname/share/{nls,misc,terminfo,zoneinfo}
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;mkdir $dirname/share/man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
done &amp;&amp;
mkdir /var/{lock,log,mail,run,spool} &amp;&amp;
mkdir -p /var/{tmp,opt,cache,lib/misc,local} &amp;&amp;
mkdir /opt/{bin,doc,include,info} &amp;&amp;
mkdir -p /opt/{lib,man/man{1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}} &amp;&amp;
ln -s ../var/tmp /usr</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Normally, directories are created with permission mode 755, which isn't
desired for all directories. The first change is a mode 0750 for the 
/root directory. This is to make sure that not just everybody can 
enter the /root directory (the same a user would do with /home/username 
directories). The second change is a mode 1777 for the tmp 
directories. This way, any user can write data to the /tmp or /var/tmp 
directory but cannot remove another user's files (the latter is caused 
by the so-called "sticky bit" - bit 1 of the 1777 bit mask).</para>

<para><screen><userinput>chmod 0750 /root &amp;&amp;
chmod 1777 /tmp /var/tmp</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Now that the directories are created, copy the source files that were
downloaded in chapter 3 to some subdirectory under /usr/src (you
will need to create the desired directory yourself).</para>

<title>FHS compliance notes</title>

<para>The FHS stipulates that the /usr/local directory should contain the
bin, games, include, lib, man, sbin, and share subdirectories. You can
alter your /usr/local directory yourself if you want your system to be
FHS-compliant.</para>

<para>Also, the standard says that there should exist a /usr/share/games 
directory, which we don't much like for a base system. But feel free to 
make your system FHS-compliant if you wish. The FHS isn't precise as 
to the structure of the /usr/local/share subdirectories, so we took the 
liberty of creating the directories that we felt were needed.</para>
