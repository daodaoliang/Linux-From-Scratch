<para><userinput>--with-root-prefix="":</userinput> The
reason for supplying this option is because of the setup of the
e2fsprogs Makefile. Some programs are essential for system use when,
for example, /usr isn't mounted (like the e2fsck program). These 
programs and libraries, therefore, belong in directories like /lib and 
/sbin. If this option isn't passed to E2fsprogs's configure, it places 
these programs in /usr, which is not what we want.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-elf-shlibs:</userinput> This creates shared
libraries that some programs in this package can make use of.</para>

<para><userinput>make install-libs:</userinput> This installs the shared
libraries that are built.</para>
