<title>Installation of Ed</title>

<para>Ed is an optional package. The only program on a normal LFS system
that uses ed is patch. But these days, ed patch files are quite rare in
favour of the diff format patch files. So, if you personally have no
need to use ed, you can skip it.</para>

<para>Install Ed by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp buf.c buf.c.backup &amp;&amp;
sed 's/int u/int u, sfd/' buf.c.backup | \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed '/.*\*mktemp.*/d' | \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;sed 's/.*if (mktemp.*/  sfd = mkstemp(sfn);\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if ((sfd == -1) || (sfp = fopen (sfn, "w+")) == NULL)/' &gt; buf.c &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
mv /usr/bin/ed /usr/bin/red /bin</userinput></screen></para>
