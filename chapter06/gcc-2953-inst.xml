<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed its
default optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options).
Therefore, if you have defined any environment variables that override
default optimizations, such as CFLAGS and CXXFLAGS, we recommend unsetting
or modifying them when building GCC.</para>

<para>This is an older release of GCC which we are going to install for the
purpose of compiling the Linux kernel in Chapter 8. This version is recommended
by the kernel developers when you need absolute stability. Later versions of
GCC have not received as much testing for Linux kernel compilation. Using a
later version is likely to work, however, we recommend adhering to the kernel
developer's advice and using the version here to compile your kernel.</para>

<para>We'll install this older release of GCC into the non-standard prefix of
<filename class="directory">/opt</filename> so as to avoid interfering with
the system GCC already installed in <filename class="directory">/usr</filename>
