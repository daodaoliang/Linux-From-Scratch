<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../gcc-&gcc-patch-version;.patch:</userinput>
This new patch deals with incorrect handling of weak symbols, the
over-optimization of calls to those weak symbols, an atexit issue and
the  __dso_handle symbol required for atexit's proper function.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-languages=c,c++:</userinput> This only builds the C
and C++ compilers and not the other available compilers as they are, on
the average, not often used. If those other compilers are needed,
the --enable-languages parameter can be omitted.</para>

<para><userinput>--enable-threads:</userinput> C++ exception handling for 
multithreaded code will not work if gcc is compiled without 
--enable-threads.</para>
