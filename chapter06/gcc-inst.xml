<title>Installation of GCC</title>

<para>This package is known to behave badly when you have changed it's default
optimization flags (including the -march and -mcpu options). GCC is best
left alone, so we recommend you unsetting CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS and other
such variables/settings that would change the default optimization that
it comes with.</para>

<para>Install GCC by running the following commands. These commands will build
the C and C++ compiler. Other compilers are available within the gcc
package. If you want to build all the other availble compilers too,
leave out the --enable-languages=c,c++ option in the configure command.
See the GCC documentation for more details on which additional compilers
are available.</para>

<para>Note: the build of other compilers is not tested by the people 
who actively work on LFS.</para>
