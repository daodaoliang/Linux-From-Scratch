<userinput>mknod -m 0666 /dev/null c 1 3:</userinput> Glibc needs a
null device to compile properly. All other devices will be created in the
next section.
</para>

<para>
<userinput>touch /etc/ld.so.conf</userinput> One of the final steps of
the Glibc installation is running ldconfig to update the dynamic loader
cache. If this file isn't present Glibc will abort with an error that it
can't read the file. So we create an empty file for it (the empty file 
will have Glibc default to using /lib and /usr/lib which is fine right now).
</para>

<para>
<userinput>--enable-add-ons:</userinput> This enables the add-on that
we install with Glibc: linuxthreads
