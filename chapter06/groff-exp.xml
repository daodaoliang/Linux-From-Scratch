<userinput>CXXFLAGS=-Dstrerror=strerror</userinput>: If no macro
strerror is defined, src/include/lib.h declares an function prototype
for strerror which is incompatible with Glibc's /usr/include/string.h.
By defining strerror=strerror a macro is defined which prevents the
declaration and does not alter the meaning of strerror.
