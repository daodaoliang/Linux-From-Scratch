<para>The installation of all the software is pretty straightforward, and
you will probably think it would be so much easier and shorter to give
the generic installation instructions for a package here and only explain
in full the installation of those packages that require an alternate
method. Although we agree with that, we choose to give the 
full instructions for each and every package, simply to avoid any 
possible confusion and errors.</para>

<para>Now would be a good time to take a look at the optimization hint 
at <ulink url="&hints-root;optimization.txt"/> if you plan to use 
compiler optimization for the packages
installed in this chapter. Compiler optimization can make a program run
faster, but may also cause compilation problems. If you run into problems
when using optimization, always try it without optimization to see if 
the problem persists.</para>

<para>Please refrain from installing more than one package at a time, even
if it may save you time (especially with dual CPU machines). If you install
the wrong package at the wrong time, it may hard-wire program paths to
<filename class="directory">$LFS/static</filename> which will cause the
programs to stop working once the static directory is removed. The order
packages are installed in this chapter have to be followed exactly to be
sure nothing is hard-wiring the static paths.</para>
