The installation of all the software is pretty straightforward and
a user will think it's so much easier and shorter to give the generic 
installation instructions for each package and only explain how to 
install something if a certain package requires an alternate installation 
method. Although I agree on that, I, however, choose to give the 
full instructions for each and every package. This is simply to avoid any 
possible confusion and errors.
