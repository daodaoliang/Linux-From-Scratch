<title>Installation of the kernel headers</title>

<para>We won't be compiling a new kernel yet -- we'll do that when we have
finished the installation of all the packages. But as some packages need the
kernel header files, we're going to unpack the kernel archive now, set it up,
and copy the header files to where they will be found by these packages.</para>

<para>The kernel headers are copied by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>ln -s /static/bin/pwd /bin/pwd &amp;&amp;
make mrproper &amp;&amp;
make include/linux/version.h &amp;&amp;
make symlinks &amp;&amp;
mkdir /usr/include/asm &amp;&amp;
cp include/asm/* /usr/include/asm &amp;&amp;
cp -R include/asm-generic /usr/include &amp;&amp;
cp -R include/linux /usr/include &amp;&amp;
touch /usr/include/linux/autoconf.h &amp;&amp;
rm /bin/pwd</userinput></screen></para>
