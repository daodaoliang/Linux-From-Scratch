The <quote>hash -r</quote> command is to make bash forget about the
locations of previously executed commands. If you have executed ldd
before, bash expects it to be found in /usr/bin. Since we moved it to
/bin, the cache needs to be purged so bash can find it in /bin when you
want to execute it again.

<para>
You might have noticed that we don't use the compiler optimizations for
this package. The reason is that overriding the CFLAGS variable causes
compilation problems. You would have to edit the Config.mk file and add
the proper values to the CFLAGS variable and then compile the package.
If you want to do that it's up to you. I don't think it's worth the
trouble though. The ld and ldd programs usually are only rarely used.
