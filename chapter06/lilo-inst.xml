<title>Installation of Lilo</title>

<para>We have chosen Lilo as a boot loader because we feel comfortable with it, but you 
may wish to choose another. Fabio Fracassi has written a hint on 
GRUB, which is available at <ulink url="&hints-root;grub-howto.txt"/>.</para>

<para>Compile Lilo:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And finish off installing the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>It appears that compilation of this package fails on certain machines
when the <emphasis>-g</emphasis> compiler flag is used. If you can't compile
Lilo at all, you should try to remove the <emphasis>-g</emphasis> value from
the CFLAGS variable in the <filename>Makefile</filename> file.</para>

<para>At the end of the installation, a message will appear stating that
<filename>/sbin/lilo</filename> has to be executed. This is pointless because
the <filename>/etc/lilo.conf</filename> file isn't present yet. We will
complete the installation of lilo in Chapter 8.</para>

<para>The standard LILO prompt, or menu, may be replaced by the
LFS logo or any logo you like. Martin Imobersteg has written a
hint about this, which is located at 
<ulink url="&hints-root;bootlogo.txt"/>.</para>
