<title>Installation of Lilo</title>

<para>We have chosen Lilo because we feel comfortable with it, but you 
may wish to take a look elsewhere. Someone has written a hint on 
GRUB at <ulink
url="&hints-root;grub-howto.txt">&hints-root;grub-howto.txt</ulink>,
 an alternative boot loader.</para>

<para>Install Lilo by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>It appears that compilation of this package fails on certain machines
when the -g compiler flag is being used. If you can't compile Lilo at
all, you should try to remove the -g value from the CFLAGS variable in the
<filename>Makefile</filename> file.</para>

<para>At the end of the installation the make install process will print a
message stating that /sbin/lilo has to be executed to complete the
update. Don't do this as it has no use. The /etc/lilo.conf isn't present
yet. We will complete the installation of lilo in chapter 8.</para>

<para>Maybe you'll be interested to know that someone wrote a hint on 
how to get a logo instead the the standard LILO prompt or menu. Take 
a look at it at <ulink
url="&hints-root;bootlogo.txt">&hints-root;bootlogo.txt</ulink>
.</para>
