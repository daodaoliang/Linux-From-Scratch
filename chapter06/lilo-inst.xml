<para>
It appears that compilation of this package fails on certain machines
when the -g compiler flag is being used. If you can't compile Lilo at
all, please try removing the -g value from the CFLAGS variable in the
<filename>Makefile</filename> file.

<para>
At the end of the installation the make install process will print a
message stating that you have to execute /sbin/lilo to complete the
update. Don't do this as it has no use. The /etc/lilo.conf isn't present
yet. We will complete the installation of lilo in chapter 8.
