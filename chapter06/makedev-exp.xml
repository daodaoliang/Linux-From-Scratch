<para><userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic:</userinput> This creates a whole
bunch of devices. Normally, these are all the devices you will need. But it
is possible that some special devices needed for your hardware configuration
are missing. Create these with ./MAKEDEV -v &lt;device&gt;.
The <userinput>generic-nopty</userinput> option mostly creates the same
devices as <userinput>generic</userinput>, but skips those that aren't
needed if you are using devpts.</para>
