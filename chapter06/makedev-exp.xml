<para><userinput>./MAKEDEV -v generic:</userinput> This creates generic
devices. Normally, these devices are all the devices you need. It's possible 
that you are missing some special devices that are needed for your hardware
configuration. Create them with ./MAKEDEV -v &lt;device&gt;.  
The <userinput>generic-nopty</userinput> option does a similar job but skips
some devices which are not needed if you are using devpts.</para>
