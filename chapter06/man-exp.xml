<para><userinput>PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin ./configure -default</userinput>:
The paths to some programs get written into man's files. Unfortunately, the
configure script picks the last location in PATH rather than the first
where a program is found. By appending /usr/bin:/bin to PATH for the
./configure command, we make sure that man doesn't use the /static versions
of our programs.</para>

<para><userinput>sed '/^PAGER/s/-is/-isR/'</userinput>:
The version of groff we installed supports SGR (Set Graphics Rendition)
escape sequences. In order for our man pages to display properly, we
add the R argument to the call for the less pager.</para>
