<para><userinput>PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin:/bin ./configure -default</userinput>:
The paths to some programs get written into man's files. Unfortunately, the
configure script picks the last location in PATH rather than the first
where a program is found. By appending /usr/bin:/bin to PATH for the
./configure command, we make sure that man doesn't use the /static versions
of our programs.</para>

<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../man-&man-patch-version;.patch:</userinput>
This patch comments out one of the files in the <filename>man.conf</filename>
file (MANPATH /usr/man) because it will create redundant results when using
programs like <userinput>whatis</userinput>. It also adds the
<emphasis>-R</emphasis> option to the <emphasis>PAGER</emphasis> variable so
man pages are displayed properly.</para>
