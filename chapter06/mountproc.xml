<title>Mounting the proc file system</title>

<para>In order for certain programs to function properly, the proc file
system must be available within the chroot'ed environment.
As a file system can be mounted as many times and in as many places
as you like, it's not a problem that the proc file system is already
mounted on your host system -- especially so because proc is a
virtual file system.</para>

<para>The proc file system is mounted under
<filename class="directory">/proc</filename> by running the
following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mount proc /proc -t proc</userinput></screen></para>
