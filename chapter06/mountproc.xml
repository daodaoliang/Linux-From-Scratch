<title>Mounting the proc file system</title>
<?dbhtml filename="proc.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>In order for certain programs to function properly, the proc file
system must be available within the chroot environment.
As a file system can be mounted as many times and in as many places
as you like, it's not a problem that the proc file system is already
mounted on your host system -- especially so because proc is a
virtual file system.</para>

<para>The proc file system is mounted under
<filename class="directory">/proc</filename> by running the
following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>mount proc /proc -t proc</userinput></screen></para>

<para>You will most likely get some warning messages from the mount
command, such as these:</para>

<blockquote><screen>warning: can't open /etc/fstab: No such file or directory
not enough memory</screen></blockquote>

<para>Ignore these, they're just due to the fact that the system
isn't installed completely yet and some files are missing. The mount itself
will be successful and that's all we care about at this point.</para>
