<title>Creating the mtab file</title>
<?dbhtml filename="mtablink.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>The next thing to do is to create the <filename>/etc/mtab</filename> file.
This is done using the following command:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>touch /etc/mtab</userinput></screen></para>

<para>As of LFS-Bootscripts 1.11 this file is handled correctly
so there are no errors even when booting after a crash.</para>

<para>Note that this requires
support for the proc filesystem to be compiled into the kernel.
This support is included by default.
Don't remove it
unless you <emphasis>really</emphasis> know what you are doing,
as other important things also depend on it.
In short, make sure proc filesystem support is enabled in the kernel.</para>
