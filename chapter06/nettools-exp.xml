<para><userinput>make update:</userinput> This does the same as a
<userinput>make install</userinput> with the exception that make update
doesn't make backups of files it's replacing. One of the things
net-tools replaces is sh-utils's version of
<filename>/bin/hostname</filename> (net-tools's version is far better
than sh-utils's version).</para>

<para>Also, if you decide to reinstall this package at some point in the
future, a <userinput>make update</userinput> won't backup all the files
from a previous net-tools installation.</para>
