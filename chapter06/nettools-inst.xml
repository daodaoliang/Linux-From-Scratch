<title>Installation of Net-tools</title>

<para>If you don't know what to answer to all the questions asked during
the <userinput>make</userinput> phase, then just accept the defaults, which
will be just fine in the majority of the cases. What you are asked here
are a bunch of questions relating to the kind of network protocols that you
have enabled in your kernel.</para>

<para>The default answers will enable the tools from this package to work
with the most common protocols such as TCP, PPP and a bunch of others. You
still need to actually enable these protocols in the kernel. What you do
here is merely telling the programs to be able to use those protocols, but
it's up to the kernel to make them available to the system.</para>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you intend to accept the default settings, you may skip
the questions generated by <emphasis>make</emphasis> by running
<userinput>yes "" | make</userinput> instead.</para>

<para>Finish installing the package:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen></para>
