<para>Install Perl by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./Configure -Dprefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you don't want to answer all those questions Perl asks, you can
add the -d option to the configure script and Perl will use all the
default settings. To avoid the Configure script asking questions
after the config.sh file has been created you can pass the -e parameter
to perl as well. The commands with these parameters included will be:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>./Configure -Dprefix=/usr -d -e &amp;&amp;
make &amp;&amp;
make install</userinput></screen></para>
