<title>Creating passwd and group files</title>
<?dbhtml filename="pwdgroup.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>In order for the user and the group "root" to be recognized and to be
able to login, there need to be entries in the /etc/passwd and /etc/group file. 
Besides the group "root", a couple of other groups are recommended or needed
by some packages. The groups created below aren't part of any standard.
The LSB only recommends a group "bin" with GID 1 to be present besides 
"root". Other group names and GIDs can be chosen by the user.
Well-written packages don't depend on GID numbers, but use the group's
name; so it doesn't matter which GID a group has. Since there
aren't any standards for groups, the groups created here are the groups the
MAKEDEV script (the script that creates the device files in the /dev
directory) mentions.</para>
