<title>Creating the passwd and group files</title>
<?dbhtml filename="pwdgroup.html" dir="chapter06"?>

<para>In order for <emphasis>root</emphasis> to be able to login and for the 
name "root" to be recognized, there need to be relevant entries in the 
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/group</filename> files.</para>

<para>Create the <filename>/etc/passwd</filename> file by running the following 
command:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/passwd &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen>

<para>The actual password for <emphasis>root</emphasis> (the "x" here is just a 
placeholder) will be set later.</para>

<para>Create the <filename>/etc/group</filename> file by running the following 
command:</para>

<screen><userinput>cat &gt; /etc/group &lt;&lt; "EOF"</userinput>
root:x:0:
bin:x:1:
sys:x:2:
kmem:x:3:
tty:x:4:
tape:x:5:
daemon:x:6:
floppy:x:7:
disk:x:8:
lp:x:9:
dialout:x:10:
audio:x:11:
<userinput>EOF</userinput></screen>

<para>The created groups aren't part of any standard -- they are the groups 
that the MAKEDEV script in the next section uses. Besides the group "root", the 
LSB (<ulink url="http://www.linuxbase.org"/>) recommends only a group "bin", 
with a GID of 1, be present. All other group names and GIDs can be chosen 
freely by the user, as well-written packages don't depend on GID numbers but 
use the group's name.</para>

<para>Lastly, we re-login to the chroot environment.  User name and group name
resolution will start working immediately after the 
<filename>/etc/passwd</filename> and <filename>/etc/group</filename> files are 
created, because we installed a full Glibc in Chapter 5.  This will get rid of 
the <quote>I have no name!</quote> prompt.</para>

<screen><userinput>exec /tools/bin/bash --login +h</userinput></screen>

<para>Note the use of the <userinput>+h</userinput> directive. This tells
<userinput>bash</userinput> not to use its internal path hashing. Without this
directive, <userinput>bash</userinput> would remember the paths to binaries it
has executed. Since we want to use our newly compiled binaries as soon as
they are installed, we turn off this function for the duration of this
chapter.</para>
