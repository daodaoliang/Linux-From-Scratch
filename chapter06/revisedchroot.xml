<para>From now on when you exit the chroot environment and wish to re-enter
it, you should run the following modified chroot command:</para>

<screen><userinput>chroot $LFS /usr/bin/env -i \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;HOME=/root TERM=$TERM PS1='\u:\w\$ ' \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/usr/sbin \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/bin/bash --login</userinput></screen>

<para>Additionally, now that all software has been installed, there is no longer
a need for the <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> directory. You may
delete it. As this will also remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect and
DejaGnu, which were used for running the toolchain tests, you will need to
recompile and re-install them on your LFS system if you want to use these
programs later.</para>

<para>Also you may now want to move the contents of
<filename class="directory">/sources</filename> to
<filename class="directory">/usr/src/packages</filename> or something similar
(or simply delete them if you've burned them on a CD) and delete the
directory.</para>
