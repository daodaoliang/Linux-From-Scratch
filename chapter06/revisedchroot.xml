<para>From now on when you exit the chroot environment and wish to re-enter
it, you should run the following modified chroot command.</para>

<para>Additionally, now that all software has been installed, there is no longer
a need for the <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> directory. You may
delete it. This will also remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect and
DejaGnu, which were used for running tests on the software as it was built. If
you want to use these programs later, you will need to compile and install them
on your new LFS system.</para>
