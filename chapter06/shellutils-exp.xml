<para><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../sh-utils-&sh-utils-hostname-patch-version;.patch:</userinput> This patch
suppresses the build of the hostname program which we will be installed
later with the net-tools package. The hostname program from the net-tools
package is a much better version (and in some cases even required since it
supports options that are needed by some programs such as XFree86).</para>
