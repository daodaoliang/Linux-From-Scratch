<title>Installation of Sysvinit</title>

<para>When run levels are changed (for example, when halting the system),
init sends the TERM and KILL signals to the processes which it started.
Init prints "Sending processes the TERM signal" to the screen. This seems
to imply that init is sending these signals to all the currently running
processes. To avoid this confusion, the init.c file can be modified, so
that the sentence reads "Sending processes started by init the TERM
signal".</para>

<para>Edit the halt message:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp src/init.c{,.backup}
sed 's/Sending processes/Sending processes started by init/g' \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/init.c.backup &gt; src/init.c</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Compile Sysvinit:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make -C src</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And install it:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make -C src install</userinput></screen></para>
