<title>Installation of Sysvinit</title>

<para>When run levels are changed (for example, when halting the system)
init sends the TERM and KILL signals to the processes which it started.
init prints "Sending processes the TERM signal" to the screen. This seems
to imply that init is sending these signals to all the currently running
processes. To avoid this confusion, the init.c file can be modified, so
that the sentence reads "Sending processes started by init the TERM signal",
by running the following commands. If you don't want to change it,
skip it.</para>

<para><screen><userinput>cp src/init.c{,.backup} &amp;&amp;
sed 's/Sending processes/Sending processes started by init/g' \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;src/init.c.backup &gt; src/init.c</userinput></screen></para>

<para>Install Sysvinit by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>make -C src &amp;&amp;
make -C src install</userinput></screen></para>
