You need to unpack both the vim-rt and vim-src packages to install Vim.

If you are planning on installing the X Window system on your LFS
system, you might want to re-compile Vim after you have installed X. Vim
comes with a nice GUI version of the editor which requires X and a few
other libraries to be installed. For more information read the Vim
documentation.
