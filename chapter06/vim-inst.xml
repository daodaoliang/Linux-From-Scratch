<title>Installation of Vim</title>

<para>This package requires its patch to be applied before you can
install it. Make sure it's unpacked before running the installation 
commands.</para>

<para>If you not wish to install Vim, build instructions for
alternative editors are available at
<ulink url="&blfs-root;view/cvs/postlfs/editors.html"/>.
Currently, there are instructions for Emacs, nano, and joe.</para>

<para>Install Vim by running the following commands:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../vim-&vim-patch-version;.patch &amp;&amp;
./configure --prefix=/usr &amp;&amp;
make CPPFLAGS=-DSYS_VIMRC_FILE=\\\"/etc/vimrc\\\" &amp;&amp;
make install &amp;&amp;
ln -s vim /usr/bin/vi</userinput></screen></para>

<para>If you plan to install the X Window system on your LFS
system, you might want to re-compile Vim after you have installed X. Vim
comes with a nice GUI version of the editor which requires X and a few
other libraries to be installed. For more information read the Vim
documentation.</para>
