This chapter will create the necessary scripts that are run at boottime.
These scripts perform tasks such as remounting the root file system
mounted read-only by the kernel into read-write mode, activiating the swap
partition(s), running a check on the root file system to make sure it's
intact and starting the daemons that the system uses.
