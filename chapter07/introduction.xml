<para>This chapter will create the necessary scripts that are run at boot time.
These scripts perform tasks such as remounting the root file system
mounted read-only by the kernel into read-write mode, activating the swap
partition(s), running a check on the root file system to make sure it's
intact, setting up networking and starting the daemons that the 
system uses.</para>

<para>We will be using SysV style init scripts. We have chosen this style 
because it is widely used and we feel comfortable with it. If you want to 
try something else, someone has written an LFS-Hint on BSD style init scripts 
at <ulink
url="&hints-root;bsd-init.txt">&hints-root;bsd-init.txt</ulink>
.</para>

<para>If you decided to copy&amp;paste the scripts from this chapter, you
would do best to copy&amp;paste them in small chunks, one screenfull at a
time. Some scripts are too large to fit in the copy buffer and will be
truncated when you paste it.</para>
