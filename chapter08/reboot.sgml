<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>
Now that all software has been installed, bootscripts have been created, 
it's time for you to reboot your computer. Shutdown your system with
shutdown -r now and reboot into LFS. After the reboot you will have a normal
login prompt like you have on your normal Linux system (unless you use XDM or
some sort of other Display Manger (like KDM - KDE's version of XDM).

One thing remains to be done and that's setting up networking. After you
rebooted and finished the next chapter of this book your LFS system is
ready for use and you can do with it whatever you want.
