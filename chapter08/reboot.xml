<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>Now that all software has been installed, bootscripts have been created, 
it's time to reboot the computer. Before we reboot let's exit the
chroot'ed environment first and unmount the LFS partition by running:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>umount $LFS/proc &amp;&amp;</userinput>
<userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen></para>

<para>And you can reboot your system by running something like:</para>

<para><screen><userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput></screen></para>

<para>At the LILO: prompt make sure that you tell it to boot 
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> and not the default entry which will boot your
host system again.</para>

<para>After you have rebooted, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>
