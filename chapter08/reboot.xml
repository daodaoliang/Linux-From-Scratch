<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>
Now that all software has been installed, bootscripts have been created, 
it's time to reboot the computer. Run a command like
<userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput> or
<userinput>/sbin/reboot</userinput> to reboot your system and at the
LILO: prompt make sure that you tell it to boot

<para>
During the first boot you will get a few errors from syslogd and klogd.
These errors occur because we haven't setup networking yet. That will
be taken care of in the next chapter. So don't worry about those errors
for now.
</para>

<para>
As just stated, one thing remains to be done and that's setting up 
networking. After having rebooted and finished the next chapter of this 
book the LFS system is completely ready for use, and you can start
adding your own software.
