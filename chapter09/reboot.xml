<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it's time to exit the
chroot environment and reboot the computer. Before we exit the chroot
environment, let's unmount any mounted virtual file systems by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount /proc
umount /dev/pts</userinput></screen>

<para>Exit the chroot environment:</para>
<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

<para>Before we reboot, let's unmount the LFS partition itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If you earlier decided to create multiple partitions, you'll need to
unmount the other partitions before you unmount $LFS, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>And now you can reboot your system by running something like:</para>

<screen><userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>At the Grub menu make sure that you tell it to boot 
<emphasis>lfs</emphasis> and not the default entry which will boot your
host system again.</para>

<para>After you have rebooted, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>
