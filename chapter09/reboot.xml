<title>Rebooting the system</title>

<para>Now that all of the software has been installed, it's time to exit the
chroot environment and reboot the computer. Before we exit the chroot
environment, let's unmount any mounted virtual file systems by running:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount /proc
umount /dev/pts</userinput></screen>

<para>Exit the chroot environment:</para>
<screen><userinput>logout</userinput></screen>

<para>Additionally, now that all software has been installed, there is no longer
a need for the <filename class="directory">/tools</filename> directory. You may
delete it. As this will also remove the temporary copies of Tcl, Expect and
DejaGnu, which were used for running the toolchain tests, you will need to
recompile and re-install them on your LFS system if you want to use these
programs later.</para>

<para>Also you may now want to move the contents of
<filename class="directory">/sources</filename> to
<filename class="directory">/usr/src/packages</filename> or something similar
(or simply delete them if you've burned them on a CD) and delete the
directory.</para>

<para>Before we reboot, let's unmount the LFS partition itself:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>If you earlier decided to create multiple partitions, you'll need to
unmount the other partitions before you unmount $LFS, like this:</para>

<screen><userinput>umount $LFS/usr
umount $LFS/home
umount $LFS</userinput></screen>

<para>And now you can reboot your system by running something like:</para>

<screen><userinput>/sbin/shutdown -r now</userinput></screen>

<para>Assuming the Grub boot loader was set up as outlined earlier, the
default menu should be set to boot <emphasis>LFS &milestone;</emphasis>
automatically.</para>

<para>After you have rebooted, your LFS system is ready for use and you
can start adding your own software.</para>
