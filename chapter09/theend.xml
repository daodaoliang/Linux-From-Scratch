Well done! You have finished installing your LFS system. It may have
been a long process but it was well worth it. We wish you a lot of fun
with your new shiny custom built Linux system.

If you plan to ever upgrade to a newer LFS version in the future it
will be a good idea to create the /etc/lfs-&version; file. By having
this file it is very easy for you (and for us if you are going to ask
for help with something at some point) to find out which LFS version
you have installed on your system. This can just be a null-byte file by
running <userinput>touch /etc/lfs-&version;</userinput>.

Don't forget there are serveral LFS mailinglist you can subscribe to if
you are in need of help, advice, etc. See 
<ulink url="ch01-maillists.html">Chapter 1 - Mailinglists</ulink> for
more information.

Again, we thank you for using the LFS Book and hope you found this book
useful and worth your time.
