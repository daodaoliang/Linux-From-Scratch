<para>Thank you for reading the LFS Book. We hope that you've found this book
useful and worth your time.</para>

<para>Now that you have finished installing your LFS system, you may be
wondering what to do next. As an answer to that question we have composed a
short list of resources:</para>

<itemizedlist>
<listitem><para>Beyond Linux From Scratch</para>

<para>If you want extra utilities for your LFS system, there is the Beyond
Linux From Scratch book for you. It covers the installation procedures of many
different packages beyond the scope of the LFS book. Among them are
general libraries, programming languages, graphical desktops, multimedia,
networking and printing. The BLFS project can be found at
<ulink url="&blfs-root;"/>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>LFS Hints</para>

<para>The LFS Hints are a collection of educational documents, often small,
submitted by volunteers in the LFS community. They cover subjects ranging from
dependencies to UTF-8 locales, from optimization to uGlibc, and from cloning to
TZ. The Hints are available at <ulink url="&hints-index;"/>.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>Mailing lists</para>

<para>There are several LFS mailing lists you may subscribe to if you want to
help develop the book further, assist others to build their systems, or are in
need of help yourself. See <ulink url="&lfs-root;mail.html"/> for more
information.</para></listitem>

<listitem><para>The Linux Documentation Project</para>

<para>The goal of the Linux Documentation Project is to collaborate in
all of the issues of Linux documentation. The LDP features a large collection
of HOWTOs, Guides and man pages, and can be found at
<ulink url="&tldp-root;"/>.</para></listitem>
