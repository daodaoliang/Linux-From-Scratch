These instructions will go into the LFS-CVS book once initial testing has
passed.

How to install this stuff.
These instrutions assume you unpacked checklfs-0.2 in $LFS/usr/src as
assumed by the lfs-book's instructions.

Install this package immediately after you setup the directories in chapter
5.

Install checklfs-0.2 by running the following commands:

mkdir $LFS/usr/share/checklfs &&
cp bin/* $LFS/usr/bin &&
cp -a install-logs $LFS/usr/share/checklfs

You can verify that you installed checklfs-0.2 properly by running:

PATH=$PATH:$LFS/usr/bin &&
$LFS/usr/bin/checklfs -v -c5 checklfs-0.2

Run the following to run the creating-dirs test, making sure all the
directories you just created are all present too:

$LFS/usr/bin/checklfs -v -c5 creating-dirs

After every package in chapter 5 is installed, you can run:
	$LFS/usr/bin/checklfs -v -c5 package-version

-v:      show verbose output
-c5      use with LFS-Book Chapter 5 installation: check if
         everything is statically linked
