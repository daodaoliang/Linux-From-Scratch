# Begin /etc/sysconfig/modules - Module auto-loading configuration.

# The syntax of this file is as follows:
#  <module> [<arg1> <arg2> ...]
#
# Each module should be on it's own line, and any options that you want
# passed to the module should follow it.  The line deliminator is either
# a space or a tab.

# End /etc/sysconfig/modules
