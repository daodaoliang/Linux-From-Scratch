  Added LFSCMD_BOOK environment variable for the default
  index.xml path.

o [timothy] March 2nd

  Rewrote command-line parser and much of the XML code.
  Added option -q, which returns pages matching a regex
  query. Added option -e for executing commands instead
  of printing them. This may prove helpful for creating
  dynamic installation scripts.
  
  Attempted to conform old/new lfs books by removing
  double ampersands and such. This should cut down on
  diff spam.
