NAME
       LFSCMD - Extract LFS/BLFS book commands.

SYNOPSIS
       lfscmd [options] [index.xml]

DESCRIPTION
       lfscmd extracts commands from the LFS and BLFS books.
       The commands may be printed, executed, or written
       to files. lfscmd can record the title of the current page
       and select pages which match a regular expression.

       lfscmd  tries  to  conform  older  books  to the new
       command structure.  For instance, lfscmd removes double
       ampersands and disregards the space between command
       blocks.

       lfscmd might be used to:

       *      Reference the build instructions of one or more
              packages.

       *      Determine the command changes between arbitrary
              versions of a  particular  package, with assistance
              from diff(1).

       *      Automate installation scripts by executing commands
              for one or more packages on the fly.

OPTIONS
       -e     Execute commands.

       -f     Write commands to their own file.

       -a     Strip '&&' in commands.
       
       -q query
              Output pages matching regex query.

       -t     Print titles (as comments).

       -x     Give executable permission to the resulting files.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
       LFSCMD_BOOK
              The full path to the index page of the default book.
