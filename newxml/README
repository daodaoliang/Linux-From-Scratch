README for the newxml module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

DocBook XML DTD 4.3CR2 - this is required as the 4.2 version doesn't properly
                         support XIncludes

DocBook XSL Stylesheets 1.64.1 - older versions of the stylesheets had a bug
                                 which caused broken hyperlinks (they pointed to
                                 the wrong directory).

libxml2-2.6.4 & libxslt-1.1.2 - these releases have a couple of XInclude related
                                bugfixes in them


Processing the sources
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to process this version of the book simply use the following command:

xsltproc --nonet --xinclude -stringparam base.dir ~/lfs-book/ stylesheets/lfs-chunked.xsl index.xml

This will produce chunked XHTML output in the directory specified by the base.dir command line parameter (~/lfs-book/ in the example above).

In time there will be other XSL files in the stylesheets directory to process the sources into formats such as LaTeX, Text, nALFS profiles.

TODO
~~~~

1. Further split the XML sources up
2. Reintroduce some entities that were removed during the cleanup
3. Provide a css file to provide nicer output than whatever the UA's default is.
4. Decide whether we want to use the strict or traditional XHTML DTD.  Note in
   particular http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/OtherOutputForms.html#d0e23340.
5. Move the legalinfo off the titlepage.
6. Decide on what levels the TOCs should go down to.
7. Incorporate Alex's restructuring?
