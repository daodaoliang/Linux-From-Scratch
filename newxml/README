README for the newxml module
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to process this version of the book simply use the following command:

`xmllint --xinclude --postvalid index.xml > lfs-all.xml`

lfs-all.xml will now contain the entire source of the book, which you can
process using the existing commands detailed in LFS's main README file.

In time this process will change to using XSLT stylesheets which will require
a command line something like the following:

`xsltproc --xinclude lfs-[output-format].xsl index.xml`

where [output-format] will be one of a number of alternatives including (but
no doubt not limited to) XHTML, PDF, LaTeX, Text, nALFS profiles.
