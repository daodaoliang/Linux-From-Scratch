TODO

1. General
~~~~~~~~~~

  1.1. Decide on a validation method to use.  DTD's are not namespace aware
       which cause us problems with XInclude namespaces, and will likely cause
       more problems in the future.  RelaxNG looks promising but there's also
       the W3C's "XML Schema".  Docbook is available in both, and libxml2
       supports both.  DocBook 5.0 appears as if it'll be primarily based on RNG
       so it would probably be better if we can migrate to that.

       Note: Preliminary testing isn't going too well.  Validating against the
       4.3CR3 version of the Docbook RNG schema causes libxml2 to crash
       spectacularly (the process ends up getting killed!).  The 4.2 version
       seems better in that respect, but I can't seem to write a document that
       will validate against it.  All the documents I try complain that
       "<book> wasn't expected there" (line 1!).
  1.2. Upgrade to lfs-bootscripts-2.0
  1.3. Upgrade to file-4.08
  1.4. Merge Alex's structure and content changes
  1.5. Remove download location hyperlinks from chapters 5 & 6.


2. HTML
~~~~~~~

  2.1. Decide whether we want to use the strict or transitional XHTML DTD. Note
       in particular http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/OtherOutputForms.html#d0e23340.
  2.2. The legalinfo page generates it's own hyperlink ("Legal Notice") but the
       current book has it linked to via the "Copyright" message above.  Does
       this matter?
  2.3. Decide on what levels the TOCs should go down to.
       * Section elements now no longer have a TOC generated for them - the book         TOC remains unchanged as do the part and appendix level TOCs.
  2.4. Jeroen commented that the semantics of the HTML output are inaccurate. It
       looks as if it'll be too time consuming to get this fixed, but does at
       least warrant further investigation.

3. PDF
~~~~~~

  3.1. Obtain feedback on the current layout.
  3.2. Investigate the possibility of using PassiveTex in place of FOP.

4. Other Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  4.1. LaTeX - confirm that the publisher does in fact *need* this.
  4.2. TXT & PS are possible using FOP, going via XSL:FO.
  4.3. RTF may be possible in future versions of FOP.
  4.4. nALFS profiles.
