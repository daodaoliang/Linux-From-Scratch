TODO
~~~~

1. Decide on a validation method to use.  DTD's are not namespace aware
   which may cause us problems in the future.  RelaxNG looks promising but
   there's also the W3C's "XML Schema".  Docbook is available in both, and
   libxml2 supports both.
2. Decide what entities are required, other than the version entities that are
   currently in place.
3. Provide a css file to provide nicer output than whatever the UA's default is.
   * Started - needs some comments regarding layout.
4. Decide whether we want to use the strict or transitional XHTML DTD.  Note in
   particular http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/OtherOutputForms.html#d0e23340.
5. The legalinfo page:
     * It generates it's own hyperlink ("Legal Notice") but the current book has
       it linked to via the "Copyright" message above. The hyperlink also links
       to prologue/legalnotice.html which isn't produced.
6. Decide on what levels the TOCs should go down to.
   * Section elements now no longer have a TOC generated for them - the book TOC
     remains unchanged as do the part and appendix level TOCs.
7. Write some more stylesheets to produce alternative output formats.
