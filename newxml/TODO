TODO
~~~~

1. General
~~~~~~~~~~

1.1.  Decide on a validation method to use.  DTD's are not namespace aware
      which may cause us problems in the future.  RelaxNG looks promising but
      there's also the W3C's "XML Schema".  Docbook is available in both, and
      libxml2 supports both.

2. HTML
~~~~~~~

2.1. Provide a css file to provide nicer output than whatever the UA's default
     is.
       * Started - needs some comments regarding layout.
       * Binary/library names listed in "Short Description" sections should be
         in a fixed-width font.
       * URLs of "Official download locations" appear on the line below where
         they should do in chapter 6.
       * Header (naviagtion) areas, TOCs & "Titlepage" sections need font sizes
         & style fixing.
2.2. Decide whether we want to use the strict or transitional XHTML DTD. Note in
     particular http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/OtherOutputForms.html#d0e23340.
2.3. The legalinfo page generates it's own hyperlink ("Legal Notice") but the
     current book has it linked to via the "Copyright" message above.  Does this
     matter?
2.4. Decide on what levels the TOCs should go down to.
       * Section elements now no longer have a TOC generated for them - the book         TOC remains unchanged as do the part and appendix level TOCs.

3. PDF
~~~~~~

  3.1. Obtain feedback on the current layout.
  3.2. Investigate the possibility of using PassiveTex in place of FOP.

4. Other Formats
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  4.1. LaTeX - confirm that the publisher does in fact *need* this.
  4.2. TXT & PS are possible using FOP, going via XSL:FO.
  4.3. RTF may be possible in future versions of FOP.
  4.4. nALFS profiles.
