1. Reintroduce some entities that were removed during the cleanup
   * Version entities are now in
   * Decide what other entities we need
2. Provide a css file to provide nicer output than whatever the UA's default is.
   * Started - needs some comments regarding layout.
3. Decide whether we want to use the strict or traditional XHTML DTD.  Note in
   particular http://www.sagehill.net/docbookxsl/OtherOutputForms.html#d0e23340.
4. Move the legalinfo off the titlepage.
     * Started
     * It generates it's own hyperlink ("Legal Notice") but the current book has
       it linked to via the "Copyright" message above
     * It writes the legalnotice out to a randomly named file under ${base.dir}
       instead of the more preferable ${base.dir}/prologue/legalnotice.html.
5. Decide on what levels the TOCs should go down to.
   * Section elements now no longer have a TOC generated for them - the book TOC
     remains unchanged as do the part and appendix level TOCs.
6. Incorporate Alex's restructuring?
7. Write some more stylesheets to produce alternative output formats.
