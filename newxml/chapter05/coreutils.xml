<title>Installation of Coreutils</title>

<para>This package has an issue when compiled against Glibc-&glibc-version;.
Without the patch below, some of the Coreutils utilities (such as
(<command>head</command>, <command>tail</command> and <command>sort</command>)
will reject their traditional syntax, a syntax that has been in use for
approximately 30 years. This old syntax is so pervasive that compatibility
should be preserved until the many places where it is used can be updated. More
details on this are provided in the comments inside the patch itself. Use of
this patch is by no means compulsory, but not using it means you'll have to
deal with the consequences yourself: patch the many packages that still use the
old syntax. Therefore, better apply the patch:</para>

<screen><userinput>patch -Np1 -i ../coreutils-&coreutils-version;-posixver-2.patch</userinput></screen>

<para>Now prepare Coreutils for compilation:</para>

<screen><userinput>./configure --prefix=/tools</userinput></screen>

<para>Compile the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make</userinput></screen>

<para>(If you insist on testing the results, then issue:
<userinput>make RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes check</userinput>. The
<emphasis>RUN_EXPENSIVE_TESTS=yes</emphasis> parameter tells the test suite to
run several additional tests that are considered relatively expensive on some
platforms but generally are not a problem on Linux.)</para>

<para>And install the package:</para>

<screen><userinput>make install</userinput></screen>
