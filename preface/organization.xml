<para>Much of the appendices are integrated into Part II (which enlarges the
book somewhat). We believe this makes for easier reading. This way, you
don't have to keep referencing an appendix while you read Part II. That's
a real chore, especially if you're reading the txt version of this book.
This book is divided into the following parts:</para>

&pf-oz-organpart1;
&pf-oz-organpart2;
&pf-oz-organpart3;
