<para>This book is divided into the following four parts:</para>

<sect2>
<title>Part I - Introduction</title>

<para>Part I explains a few important things on how to proceed with the
installation, and gives meta information about the book (version, changelog,
acknowledgments, associated mailing lists, and so on).</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Part II - Preparing for the build</title>

<para>Part II describes how to prepare for the building process: making a
partition, downloading the packages, and compiling temporary tools.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Part III - Building the LFS system</title>

<para>Part III guides you through the building of the LFS system: compiling
and installing all the packages one by one, setting up the boot scripts, and
installing the kernel. The resulting basic Linux system is the foundation
upon which you can build other software, to extend your system in the way
you like.</para>
</sect2>

<sect2>
<title>Part IV - Appendices</title>

<para>Part IV consists of two appendices. The first is an alphabetical list of
all the packages that are installed -- for each package giving its official
download location, its contents, and its installation dependencies. The second
appendix lists all the programs and libraries installed by these packages in
alphabetical order, so you can easily find out to which package a certain
program or library belongs.</para>

<para>(Much of the first appendix is integrated into Parts II and III. This
enlarges the book somewhat, but we believe it makes for easier reading. Now
you don't have to keep referencing the appendix while doing the installation.
This going back and forth would be a real chore, especially if you're reading
a plain text version of the book.)</para>
