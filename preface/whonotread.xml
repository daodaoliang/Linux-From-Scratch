<title>Who would not want to read this book</title>

<para>
Users who don't want to build an entire Linux system from scratch
probably don't want to read this book. If a user, however, wants to learn
more about what happens behind the scenes, in particular what happens
between turning on the computer and seeing the command prompt, he wants
to read the <quote>From Power Up To Bash Prompt</quote> (P2B) HOWTO.
This HOWTO builds a bare system, in way similar to the one this book
uses, but it focusses more on just installing a bootable system instead
of a complete system.
</para>

<para>
To decide whether to read this book or the P2B HOWTO, a user could
ask himself this question: "Is my main objective to get a working Linux
system that I'm going to build myself and, along the way, learn what
every component of a system is for, or is just the learning part my main
objective?" If he wants to build and learn, he reads this book. If he just
wants to learn, then the P2B HOWTO is probably better material to read.
