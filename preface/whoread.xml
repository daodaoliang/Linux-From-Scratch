<title>Who would want to read this book</title>

<para>
This book is intended for Linux users who want to setup their own
custom-built Linux system. Reasons for wanting to build such a system are
diverse. Perhaps a user wants to get into more detail as to what
happens behind the scenes. Perhaps he is fed up with distributions
which are often bloated or perhaps he doesn't want to rely on pre-compiled
binaries due to security concerns. There are many reasons why a user may wants 
a custom-built system, but if it is one of them, this book is meant
for him.

<para>
The fruits of building an own system are plentiful, but the labour may
be hard. It is a long way ahead but in the end a user will be
able to call himself the proud owner of his own Linux system,
completely tailored after his needs. He dictates the layout of
bootscripts, the file system hierarchy, which programs are installed in
which directory, which versions of software to use, and more. Perhaps the
most important reason is to know exactly what is installed where,
why, and how.
