	* 25-lfs.rules: Add "ignore_device" to OPTIONS for DRI devices, instead
	  of setting NAME to an empty string.  This matches the way we ignore
	  devmapper / LVM devices.

2006-09-22	Bryan Kadzban	<bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 60-persistent-input.rules, 95-udev-late.rules: Import from udev-100.
	  60-persistent-input.rules creates persistent symlinks for input
	  devices, and 95-udev-late.rules enables udevmonitor.

	* 60-persistent-storage.rules: Replace ATTRS{../removable} with just
	  ATTRS{removable} on partition devices. Replace ATTRS{removable}
	  with ATTR{removable} on whole-disk devices.

2006-09-20	Bryan Kadzban	<bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* 05-early.rules: Missed a rule in the last change.  ENV{PHYSDEVBUS}
	  in the rule that waits for the "bus" symlink should be replaced by
	  SUBSYSTEMS.

2006-09-20	Bryan Kadzban	<bryan@linuxfromscratch.org>
	* Adapted rules to the new matches used in udev-098 and above (e.g.,
	  SYSFS becomes ATTRS).  Prevents warnings, and support for the old
	  matches will be removed eventually.  These rules will not work with
	  udev-097 and before!
	* Fixed several bugs in the rules left over from previous udev
	  versions (missing commas, overwriting user symlinks using ="..."
	  instead of +="...", and matching against "*" instead of "?*").

	* Renamed CHANGELOG to ChangeLog, started using pseudo-GNU-format
	  entries.  (See standards.info; search it for "changelog" to get
	  the general gist.)
