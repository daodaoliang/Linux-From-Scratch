Purpose of rules file:

This rules file allows Udev to load firmware for any device that requires it at
runtime.


Description of rules:

There is only one rule in this file.  It matches a SUBSYSTEM of "firmware",
which any device that requires firmware will use.  The rule runs the
/lib/udev/firmware.sh script.  This script will load the appropriate firmware
image onto the device, based on the environment variable FIRMWARE (which was
sent by the kernel).  It searches for firmware images in /lib/firmware and
/usr/local/lib/firmware.
